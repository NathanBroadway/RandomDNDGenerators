The chraal does not crave power or has any higher plans beyond that, making it an excellent servant for an evil master who can offer it sufficient opportunities to sate its desire. Masters who can’t provide for the chraal’s cravings will quickly find the elemental turning on them however. Allies of Convenience. Normally a chraal spends its life on its own, intermingling with no other creatures or even other chraals. They cannot breed and have no desire for company.

Unlike most undead, including those created for defensive purpose, crypt things do not have any desire to kill or inflict suffering. In fact, they resort to nonlethal methods first and foremost. Keepers of the Crypt. Crypt things exist to defend a specific location, usually a tomb, holy site, or the vault of a religious treasure. They rest in a chair or throne or within an alcove provided for them while inactive. When it notices intruders, a crypt thing will first try to convince them to leave, using diplomacy or, if it thinks the intruding creature is easily cowed, intimidation. If the intruders are not willing to listen, the creature pursues and attempts to remove them by nonlethal means. The first method it resorts to is its magical scattering ability which teleports the intruders in random directions, usually removing most, if not all of them from the site entirely. It then goes after the scattered intruders still within its crypt, attempting to subdue them or bring them to flee. It attempts to overwhelm its target, tying it up and carrying it off. The crypt thing uses its ability to cast dimension door to transport the captured creature away and then return to its vigil. The crypt thing will only resort to lethal means, using its bony claws to attack, if assaulted or if the invaders persist in returning to the tomb, giving it reason think to there is no other way to ensure that the tomb remains undisturbed in the future.

A cursed spirit’s face is an emaciated mask of death, with hollow malevolent eyes. Creations of Curse. A cursed spirit spawns from the essence of a creature that dies under the influence of a curse or some other malevolent magic. The spirit rises, consumed by the desire to pass its suffering and misfortune unto others. When finding a victim, the spirit will often proclaim the victim’s doom and impending suffering, which combined with the spirit’s twisted appearance is sometimes enough to intimidate a creature. A cursed spirit will relentlessly seek the creature that inflicted the curse upon it in the first place but lacks any special ability to locate its tormentor, so it will usually wander aimlessly, spreading suffering everywhere it goes. If a cursed spirit can find its creator and slay it, the spirit’s curse is lifted and it dissipates, free to move on to the afterlife always intended for it in life.

Nabassu start their life cycle as lesser creatures, hungering for the flesh of humanoid creatures. Once a nabassu has consumed enough flesh, it grows to its full potential. An adult nabassu is a powerful demon, easily capable of competing with glabrezus and even nalfeshnees despite its small size compared to these creatures.

It is said that some klurichirs command the hordes of the demon princes themselves, where they outrank balors, though many of them wander the abyss alone, undisturbed by lesser demons who scramble away where a klurichir walks.",

In battle, a single pod demon can cause a considerable amount of destruction in the enemy lines, which it infiltrates by sending a single, easily overlooked podspawn forward and then transferring its own essence into the spawn, transforming it into the fully grown pod demon, while its previous body reverts to a tiny podspawn.",

A jarrlak’s ice has special properties that prevent the victim from immediately expiring from the cold or lack of oxygen or any other sustenance, and some unlucky victims have to endure decades this way.

Most remarkable is their displacement ability, which is very similar, if not homologous to that of displacer beasts. Unseelie Snakes. Displacer serpents hail from the twilight lands of the feywild, just as displacer beasts do. They did not, however, receive the training and selective breeding that the more catlike beasts did, and as a result are not nearly as dangerous individually. The exact relation between the two creatures is unknown, but the similar coloration and their shared ability to project illusions suggest some form of link, be it some form of magical influence or something as simple as adapting to the same environments over time. Displacer serpents are driven by an insatiable hunger and a desire to spread suffering, which has since led to a great number of them crossing over into the material plane, where they can be found in virtually any land environment. Displacer Pits. Displacer serpents are voracious and furtive predators, usually going after smaller prey, but also not averse to hunting creatures their own size. Like most natural snakes, they spend most of their life on their own, only seeking their own kind to reproduce. Running into a nest of displacer serpents during mating season however can be a deadly encounter, even for experienced adventurers, as the serpents gather in great numbers.",

      "Converting Other Dragons",
      "Converting true dragons from other sources into ancestries for half-dragons, dragonborn and sorcerers is a fairly simple process most of the time. Normally a true dragon has one damage immunity and a breath weapon dealing the corresponding damage type. This determines which damage type should be applied to the breath weapon, Elemental Affinity and damage resistance associated with the ancestry. In some cases the dragon may have multiple immunities, or instead of an immunity have multiple damage resistances. In this case choose whichever corresponds with its breath weapon, or if this still leaves multiple options choose which one seems most defining for the dragon, or sets them apart from the dragons in the Monster Manual. The shape (line or cone), save type and damage type of the dragon’s breath weapon determines whether the corresponding dragonborn ancestry’s breath has a 15-foot cone or 5-by-30-foot line, which type of damage it deals, and which saving throw it uses. In a few rare cases, the dragon’s immunities and breath weapon damage type do not match at all. In this case use the primary immunity damage resistances, and the breath weapon’s type for breath weapons and Elemental Affinity. In case the dragon’s breath weapon deals piercing, bludgeoning or slashing damage, Elemental Affinity should instead be based on the immunity."

  "Cosmic Dragon": {
    "Details": [
      "Between chromatic and metallic dragons, the population of true dragons is already very diverse, but these are far from the only true dragons in existence. Some families of dragons exist only in remote corners of the world while others hail from other planes of existence entirely. To find some dragons, however, one needs to look to the stars. Cosmic Dragons In the emptiness between the stars, some scholars believe, life cannot exist. But wherever they may have originated from, the majestic and strange creatures known as cosmic dragons prove these theories wrong. These powerful dragons resemble their terrestrial kin in many ways: Gigantic reptilian beasts, walking on four legs, with a pair of great wings sprouting from their backs, horned heads with powerful jaws sitting atop long necks on one end and a long whiplike tail on the other. Yet they have distinctly strange features as well: from their sometimes translucent or even luminescent, smooth-skinned, though still supremely resilient, flesh in strangely vibrant colorations to tentacle-like growths sprouting from prominent spots along their bodies. Even the spokes of their wings, which on most dragons are more akin to long fingers, are more like stiffer, stronger tentacles in structure. Star Travellers. The most remarkable quality of cosmic dragons is not their appearance however. What sets them apart from most dragons and, indeed, most creatures in the Material Plane is their ability to live comfortably in the emptiness of outer space and even fly through the void, catching solar winds under their wings. They can enter a state in which they seemingly break the limitations of time and space themselves, travelling distances that seem otherwise insurmountible, even by powerful magic, travelling between different planets and even to distant stars. Although strangely, the time it takes for the dragons to travel a distance varies wildly. Sometimes the same distance takes less than a week to traverse when at other times the dragon will travel for over a month. Even a relatively short distance may take the dragon significantly more time to travel than a much longer one it traverses later. This all seems to point that the dragons do not propel themselves through the space in the way most creatures understand locomotion, but rather seem to use bents and holes in the space around them. Some cosmic dragons allow other creatures to ride on their backs, though these occurrences are rare. Somehow those creatures are protected from the vacuum and other hazards of the void. The dragons may do this in exchange for a service or even treasure, or because they have some personal interest in transporting a particular creature to another world. Eldritch Motivations. Cosmic dragons do not usually fall as neatly into moral categories as chromatic and metallic dragons do. Most of them can go either way or tend toward neither end of the spectrum, though most types of cosmic dragons have an inherent preference for either order or chaos. Cosmic dragons take a keen interest in the dealings of creatures existing bound to their home planets, each race of dragon having its own reasons and its own methods of interacting with such subjects. Some cosmic dragons may feel pity or empathy, trying to aid them in a heroic fashion, while others coldly observe or even conduct strange experiments and the most vile among cosmic dragons seek to exploit and spread anguish. If activity from aberrations and other creatures of eldritch origin, either from a time seemingly before time itself or perhaps from other worlds, if not both, is on the rise, cosmic dragons also get involved. Some cooperate with these creatures while others oppose them. These esoteric machinations are difficult enough to see through for a mortal mind, but the involvement of the cosmic dragons often occludes the matter even more, and the dragons rarely make it a point to explain to anyone else, what is really transpiring. Cosmic Dragon Ancestry",
      "Sorcerers with the Draconic origin, half-dragons, and dragonborn can be of cosmic dragon ancestry just like they can be of chromatic or metallic. Like any other sorcerers, dragonborn, or half-dragons, these individuals gain a breath weapon and resistance or affinity to a type of damage that is determined by their draconic ancestry. A half-cosmic dragon’s breath weapon is determined the same way as for any other half-dragon. Cosmic dragonborn determine the damage type, save type and shape of their breath weapon by the table below. Both dragonborn and half-dragons also gain damage resistance and sorcerers gain Elemental Affinity matching the damage type listed in the table below.

    "Details": [
      "A Moon Dragon’s Lair As with most cosmic dragons, not all moon dragons make their lairs on the surface of a populated world. Those that do however, prefer rocky areas, on the seashore, where they burrow into the stone to create a subterranean nest. The entrance is usually at the bottom of one of the deep crater-like pits, typically found near the lair, and usually created by the dragon itself. The dragon spends a large amount of its time outside— though within sight—of its lair, where it can engage in observation of the outside world and still keep watch of its hoard. A surefire way to gain a moon dragon’s attention, is to enter its lair uninvited. Though there is no guarantee that this will grant one the opportunity to have a peaceful audience with the dragon. Inside the rocky caverns, the dragon’s servants carve out places and idols of worship within the chambers around the web of tunnels the dragon has dug. A large central chamber serves as the dragon’s sanctum. The floor is rarely level in this chamber, several craters are strewn across, filled with the dragon’s hoard, the largest and deepest crater serving as its resting place.",
      "Lair Actions",
      "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: • Rocks crash from the cavern’s ceiling, possibly crushing several creatures. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll each against up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet. On a hit the target takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. • Underground water reserves surge upwards through cracks and holes in the floor, flooding craters the dragon can see and spillling out before receding and pulling creatures around in and burying them in the dragon’s hoard. Creatures within 20 feet of these craters must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled into the crater and be buried in treasure. While buried, the creature is prone and restrained. A creature can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on itself on a success. • A light glints across the dragon’s body and its form disappears where the light passes. The dragon becomes invisible. The invisibility ends on initiative count 20 on the next round.",
      "Regional Effects",
      "A region containing a moon dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects. • Within 6 miles of the lair, the sky is always clear of clouds, when the moon is visible, day or night, making navigation by the constellations more reliable. • Plantlife within 3 miles of the lair is sparse, if not completely nonexistent, and natural fauna is rare. • Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair easily lose focus and become disoriented. Once per day, creatures other than the dragon and its followers must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks for an hour. • The geography within 3 miles of the lair is interspersed with circular crater-like pits. If the dragon dies, plants regrow naturally over time, and craters remain. The other effects fade over the course of 1d10 days."

    "Details": [
      "Sun dragons are arrogant and vainglorious creatures, even for dragons. Their vibrant red flesh displays orange and yellow patterns reminiscent of sunflares erupting across their wings and bodies. Sun dragons like to think of themselves as the source of light and life and enjoy being worshipped as such by creatures they consider beneath themselves. Sunlight Incarnate. An old master of mystic arts might tell his student about how living creatures are luminous beings, rather than crude flesh. This statement couldn’t be truer than when it comes to sun dragons. Their breath weapon channels the searing light of the sun, which adds to their divine appearance. It can also be dispersed to burn and set ablaze targets with its intense heat.",
      "A sun dragon’s form can blind onlookers with radiant light, and the most ancient sun dragons can tap into their luminous forms in a way that no other living creature can hope to achieve and turn into pure light, travelling great distances at the literal speed of light. Self-Appointed Gods. Like moon dragons, sun dragons are often revered by those whose faith is centered around their respective celestial body. However, while moon dragons care little for their followers’ worship and simply appreciate them as useful servants, sun dragons feed their egos on the reverence of their worshippers and demand icons made in their glory. If a cult gathering around a sun dragon worships a sun deity, the dragon subtly influences their practices and tenets, to slowly shift them toward worshipping the dragon. This process is a slow shift, often covering generations, in which the dragon first establishes itself as an avatar of the deity and then slowly shifts the focus to itself. Depending on the dragon’s disposition, its rule can vary anywhere from that of a benevolent dictator to that of a tyrant, but it always revolves around strict codes and rules that treat all of its underlings equally. Only the dragon resides above all. While a sun dragon will welcome any worshipper who accepts its divinity and is not opposed to light, it particularly likes to surround itself with creatures associated with fire and light. Due to their geographical proximity and lizardfolk’s general tendency to worship dragons, lizardfolk are commonly found in communities gathering around sun dragons, while kobolds are often torn between their reverence for dragons and their aversion to bright light, making them a rather rare sight. Golden Sun Treasure. Gold is the most coveted substance among sun dragons. They particularly prefer coins, as they remind the dragons of a sun’s shape. They are also infatuated by golden and yellow gems and minerals, such as topases and tiger’s eyes, but anything that gleams brightly in the light pleases a sun dragon.",
      "A Sun Dragon’s Lair A sun dragon can exist comfortably, submerged in the inferno of a sun, their treasure hoards however can not. Sun dragons like to make their lairs in warm areas, exposed to as much sunlight as possible, surrounded by an abundance of life. They are most commonly found in tropical and sub-tropical areas, where the sun shines the brightest and hottest and life is teeming. A sun dragon’s hoard is not buried in an underground cavern, but sits directly under the sun, perched at the peak of a steep mountain, where its gleam can often be seen for miles. The dragon spends most of the time on its roost, overlooking its domain, “allowing” its worshippers to bask in its splendor. At the foot of the dragon’s peak, its followers build a network of temples, defensive structures, and sleeping chambers, embedded into the cliffs and protecting a precarious, winding path, crawling up the mountain toward the dragon’s roost.",

Creatures that are immune to fire damage are immune to this effect. Creatures with resistance to fire damage have advantage on the saving throw and creatures with vulnerability to fire damage have disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature that fails a saving throw against this lair action, automatically passes any further saving throws against this lair action for the next 24 hours. • A flare erupts across the floor of the lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere at a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. Creatures within the sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. • A strong wind blows toward the dragon from all directions. Creatures within 30 feet of the must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet directly toward the dragon and be knocked prone.

A creature that tries to fly into or out of the sphere takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus 35 (10d6) radiant damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for two rounds. The dragon can supress and cotinue the effect at will with no action required as long as it can see its roost. • Within 3 miles of the lair, the weather is always hot, regardless of the surrounding climate or season. This can make travel more difficult due to exhaustion. • Within 6 miles of the lair, wind always blows in the direction of the lair, allowing any creature aware of this phenomenon which knows it is within this radius to determine the direction of the lair.

    "Details": [
      "Time Dragon Dragons live for aeons, and for all scholars know, they are functionally immortal, unless they die a violent death, or choose for their life to end. A dragon’s perception of time is significantly different from that of humans or even elves. But even to other dragons the way a time dragon understands the flow of time is all but incomprehensible. Some think time dragons exist in the present, future and past simultaneously, perceiving time as a static picture, rather than ever changing flow. This is probably exaggeration but perhaps rooted in a kernel of truth, as the dragons appear to never be surprised by a sudden turn of events. Arcane Essence. Around a time dragon, the temporal flow seems to become distorted, as some creatures move and react significantly slower in the dragon’s presence. It appears, a time dragon’s essence is suffused with arcane energy in some way, as evidenced by the nature of its breath weapon. When a time dragon focusses its breath to kill, it projects a wave of glowing blue force energy, akin to the energy used only in arcane spells. When it does not intend to kill or destroy, the dragon can use",
      "its breath to temporarily disable enemies, by what appears to an observer like removing them from existence for a short amount of time. In fact the victims of this attack are not removed but simply shifted forward in time. A creature affected by this attack only experiences the contact with the dragon’s breath, before finding the situation around it abruptly having changed the next moment. This experience can be jarring, and the creature often needs a moment to adjust to the, apparently sudden, change. The eldest time dragons are rumored to be able to travel forward and backward through time. Though the dragons are not adverse to confirming this, they are extremely reluctant, to the point of absolutely refusing, to demonstrate this ability and prove the claim true. Temporary Alliances. When a time dragon chooses to associate with other creatures, it prefers to keep the company of those who may be able to bridge its understanding of time and the more limited perception of other creatures. Many spellcasters focussing on divination magic are typically found serving a time dragon. Creatures that have extremely long life expectancies or are even immortal, are also typical among a time dragon’s servant. Conversely time dragons also often love to study creatures, which live for very short periods before their natural lifetime is spent. They are fascinated by how differently such beings experience the temporal flow and how quickly their life cycle renews. It is not unusual to find elves serving a time dragon alongside goblins and orcs. The dragon typically still outlasts all of its servants, short of the few immortal ones among them, unless it is slain violently.",
      "The dragon’s servants revere the great beast for its insight into the matter they seek to understand through divination magic and look to it for sage advice and insight. At some point in their otherwise unlimited lifetimes, the most ancient time dragons disappear without a trace, leaving their servants and even their hoards behind. According to the claims of some of the dragons’ followers, the time dragon left for “home.” Scholars speculate that the dragons are drawn back to beginning of time itself, seeking their source. Record Keepers. The limited way in which other creatures experience the flow of time is fascinating to time dragons, and their hoards are collections of artifacts attesting to these creatures’ efforts to keep time. Book records, artworks such as paintings and reliefs, documenting the history of people and places are common in a time dragon’s possession. The hoard also often contains devices measuring and assisting in the management of time, such as sun dials, hourglasses and clocks, as well as calendars and even scheduling books. Perhaps most fascinating and most valuable are the records of the future a time dragon",

      "A Time Dragon’s Lair Time dragons prefer regions where the cosmic cycle can be observed in as many facets as possible. When making their lair in a world with distinct seasonal changes, they prefer temperate environments, where the contrast between summers and winters is strongest. The lair itself is usually an underground cave in elevated terrain or, if the dragon has a large enough following to construct such a lair, a gigantic tower, not unlike a wizard’s tower. The lair often contains several arcane and alchemical laboratories, in which the dragon and its followers conduct experiments and research of various nature, as well as libraries filled with historical records.",

      "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: • The dragon selectively slows or stops time in tiny, pinpointsized pockets of space in a 20-foot-radius sphere at a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, or take 14 (4d6) piercing damage, as parts of their flesh are frozen in place while the creatures move. • The dragon increases its speed dramatically for a moment. The dragon is affected as if the haste spell was cast on it until initiative count 20 on the next round. • The dragon slows the perception and reflexes of creatures within 60 feet of itself. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or their initiative score is reduced by 10 for the rest of the encounter. This changes the initiative order. A creature that already took its turn this round, does not get an additional turn because of this effect. A creature’s initiative cannot be reduced to less than 1 + the creature’s Initiative bonus.",
      "Regional Effects",
      "A region containing a time dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects. • Weather and the state of vegetation within 6 miles of the lair are inconsistent with the current geographical season and each other, as though each cycle takes place at a different rate. Strangely, this disparity does not cause any damage to the",
      "If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 months. Vegetation dies off over the course of this process and regrows naturally thereafter, while the abundant animal life outside the area scatters."

      "Void Dragon Creatures laying eyes upon a void dragon usually experience a sense of wrongness, as though what they are seeing is not supposed to exist. Some believe that these dragons were in fact a mistake of creation that sprung into existence by itself, as the universe, and with it the other cosmic dragons, were created. Others believe these irritable monstrosities have been corrupted and driven mad by the influence of the horrors lingering at the edges of existence. Unlike other cosmic dragons, who have no general moral inclinations across the entirety, or even the majority of their kind, void dragons who are not evil are basically unheard of. Destructive Nihilism. Void dragons are obsessed with entropy, destruction, and the dichotomy of existence and nonexistence. Coming out of the emptiness between the stars, they seek to return everything to this same state or perhaps an even purer state of complete nonexistence. They readily ally with other creatures that seek the same kind of complete destruction, such as the obyrith of the deepest Abyss (see page 152). Their obsessive and irritable behavior makes void dragons dangerous allies to have. The dragons have no regard for “lower” life-forms and will not refrain from sacrificing or even simply trampling them underfoot as they pursue their goals. They merely tolerate creatures’ existences—even those of void dragons, including themselves—only as long as it is helps toward the goal of ending existence itself. Oftentimes, void dragons go on destructive rampages, not unlike those of red dragons, albeit motivated more by frustration and impotent rage at their lack of ability to achieve their ultimate goal. A void dragon may be able to lay waste to entire nations, yet it would consider this as little more than an act of petty destruction, meaning little more than the act of swiping vials and flasks off a desk in exasperation when a frustrated alchemist can’t figure out the right mixture. Nothingness Incarnate. Void dragons seem to somehow consist of the very nothingness of empty space. How this is possible is unclear, but it provides a possible explanation why beholding a void dragon causes such an intense feeling of wrongness. Being in the presence of a void dragon alone can cause a dizziness akin to the feeling of standing at the edge of a chasm and staring into an infinite depth. The dragon’s breath weapon channels the void into energy that swallows light and drains life. This deadly energy appears as complete blackness in the form of a cloud of smoke or flame. The dragon can also channel its breath to remove breathable air from a subjects lungs, causing them to start suffocating immediately.",
      "Driven Hoarders. The monetary value of its hoard is meaningless to a void dragon, serving as little more than a tool for a purpose. The dragon amasses riches in order to further its goals, intending to use it to buy influence and the tools it requires. Its goals however, being as lofty as they are, often feel out of reach and so the dragon continues to collect treasures and pile them up in its lair. Void dragons prefer items of practical value, and so their hoards are filled with magic and alchemical items and ingredients the dragon has collected in hopes of making some use of it. Although it rarely finds a use, even in its gold, a void dragon will not give up any of its hoard and guards it as jealously as any dragon would.",
      "A Void Dragon’s Lair Void dragons prefer isolated places, away from other lifeforms. The vast majority lair on planets which are uninhabitable to other creatures. The one’s making their lairs in inhabited worlds are driven there by the search to find the means to achieve the unravelling of the fabric of the universe. Here they are drawn to deserts and barren wastelands, where they can maintain their isolation as much as possible.",
      "The dragon makes its lair in cavernous, dark underground tunnels, devoid of any illumination, often sectioning off areas of the underdark as its own territory. Minions the dragon tolerates in its lair usually live in spartan conditions with little more than they require to fulfill their function in the dragon’s schemes.",
      "Lair Actions",
      "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: • The dragon fills the minds of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it with a profound and unsettling feeling of wrongness. Creatures of the dragon’s choice within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. • The dragon creates a bubble of vacuum in a 20-foot-radius sphere at a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Creatures within the area take 3 (1d6) slashing damage from the negative pressure and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) thundering damage and be stunned for one round, as the surrounding air (or whichever",
      "medium the space is surrounded by) implodes violently back into the area.",
      "Regional Effects",
      "A region containing a void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects. • The air within 1 mile of the lair is notably harder to breathe. Creature’s that breathe air have disadvantage on Constitution checks and saving throws to resist exhaustion from physical activity (such as forced marches and chases). • Creatures within 3 miles of the lair have an uncanny feeling,",
      "that there is something fundamentally wrong with the area, although they cannot pinpoint the reason. • Wildlife actively avoids the area 6 miles around the dragon’s lair. Stagnant bodies of water are dried out completely. Any signs of plantlife (if there was any vegetation to begin with) are withered remains. If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. Water and plantlife return naturally, according to the climate."

  "Warp Dragon": {
    "Details": [
      "Warp Dragon All cosmic dragons are capable of moving through the space between the stars, using some strange way of altering space itself to bridge otherwise impossible distances. The unmatched masters of this method of travel are warp dragons however. These dragons understand the concept of space better than any other creature and have a unique ability to bend it to their will. These sleek, vibrantly colored, orange and blue dragons are covered in spiral patterns. Their movements are characterized by distinctive winding motions. Emissaries of Worlds. Warp dragons’ unique talents are invaluable to anyone in need of delivering something—be it a message, goods, or living creatures—to a different world, whether a different planet on the same plane of existence, or",
      "another plane entirely. Like any dragon, warp dragons are prideful and will not easily submit to the will of any other creature. On top of this, warp dragons understand their monopoly all to well and will price their services accordingly. With how rare an individual who can afford a warp dragon’s fees is, these services hardly make up a significant portion of most warp dragon’s lives. Benders of Reality. Warp dragons are uniquely capable of bending space, they can apply this ability in a great variety of ways. When travelling through space, warp dragons on average reach any destination twice as fast as any other cosmic dragon and are capable of moving between different planes of existence. In flight, a warp dragon does not make use of aerodynamics and its wings to stay aloft. The dragon instead manipulates gravity for itself, allowing it to hover at any height. It still makes use of its wings to propel itself forward and make quick turns.",
      "The dragon’s breath creates a gravtiational pull. It uses this to distort and vibrate space, creating crushing thunder or even forming a gravity well which draws a victim right into the dragon’s maw, where it is swallowed. Despite its slender physique, a void dragon can swallow comparably large creatures, as the space within the creature itself is inconsistent with the outside and victims are pulled through a bend in reality. Fully mature warp dragons are capable of attacking through folds in space, snapping their jaws at creatures far outside of their apparent physical reach. Even the dragon’s presence seems to warp its surroundings. Creatures within its vicinity have their sight obscured, as everything around them appears to be twisted into a spiralling vortex, making them easier prey for the dragon.",
      "Willful Leaders. Driven by an urge to impose their will on others, warp dragons have different ways of attaining followers and minions, depending on their moral disposition. Evil warp dragons are violent conquerors who enslave all who oppose them, while more kindly inclined ones try to convince other creatures to see things their way and accept willing followers. Either way, warp dragons do not tolerate disobedience and are quick to punish any such behavior. The majority of a warp dragon’s followers that live in its lair are amphibious in some way, making creatures like sahuagin one of the most common sights within a warp dragon’s lair. Spiral Obsession. Warp dragons are obsessed with spirals. They can spend hours losing themselves in observing these geometric shapes and collect anything displaying them, from snail and nautilus shells to springs taken from mechanical contraptions and artworks depicting helix and spiral shapes. The more valuable items from among this collection end up in the dragon’s hoard while items without monetary value are often scattered across its lair for display and decoration purposes.",
      "A Warp Dragon’s Lair Warp dragons like to make their lairs in underground caverns, hiding the entrance under water and making it as difficult to access as possible, at least to non-amphibious creatures. These ports are placed at the underside of a rock outcropping or the ceiling of a submerged cave so as to prevent water from flooding into the lair. The lair’s corridors wind and cross in confusing patterns, making navigation difficult, even for creatures that are familiar with its general layout. The walls are decorated with trinkets displaying spiral patterns. These items are usually of no monetary value as such objects are kept in the dragon’s hoard.",
      "Regional Effects",
      "A region containing a warp dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects. • Travellers within 3 miles of the lair randomly feel subtly lighter or heavier at different intervals ranging from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Altogether these changes have no short term effect and balance each other out for longer activities. • Creatures travelling through the area within 6 miles of the lair sometimes get turned around for no discernible reason. For every mile a group travels in the area, the DM rolls a d20. On a result of 1 or 2, the group gets turned around in a direction of the DM’s choice and after an hour of travelling must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check in order to realize they are travelling in the wrong direction. Each full hour the group travels, each member is allowed an additional Wisdom (Survival) check to realize they have been turned around. At the DM’s discretion, another check may be necessary to determine which way will take them back toward their intended destination. • Weather, plants and even animals living in the area within 3 miles of the lair display subtle spiral patterns, in the shapes of clouds, and swirling winds, the growth of their branches, leaves, and tendrils, the structure of their bark, or the markings on their skin or fur. Some creatures even follow such patterns in certain behaviors, such as birds and insects swarming in helix patterns, forming swirling cylinder or vortex shapes in the air, and ground-dwelling animals inadvertently wandering in continually shrinking circles as they search for food. If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",
      "Lair Actions",
      "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: • The dragon sends a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself through a fold in space. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. • Gravity reverses momentarily around the dragon. Creatures other than the dragon within 60 feet of the dragon fall 20 feet straight up into the air and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, falling prone and taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall back to the ground on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that can fly have advantage on this saving throw. • The dragon chooses a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere around that point suddenly feel significantly heavier. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, or their speed is halved and they gain disadvantage on all Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Strength (Athletics) checks for one minute. Flying creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check at the start of each of their turns to stay afloat. If a creature fails this check, it immediately falls. At the start of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."

Nomadic Raiders. Tribes of drakkoths wander warm forests, living a nomadic lifestyle and raiding other creatures’ settlements they come across, including those of other drakkoth tribes. They do not always keep to themselves however, having been known to ally with other drakkoth tribes or reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk or naga, to accomplish greater goals. Life Without Mercy. Drakkoths grow up in a tribal society that is all but stranger to the concept of mercy. Their tribes value strength over anything, and allowing a beaten enemy to live is considered a sign of weakness. When a conflict breaks out within a tribe, it almost always ends in the death of either party. Failing or betraying the chief or commiting a crime against the tribe will invariably be punished by death. As a result a drakkoth never shows mercy to its foes and never expects any in return. The only time a drakkoth might spare an opponent’s life is if there is some benefit to taking them prisoner or perhaps sending them back to their leader with a message. Reverence of Dragons. Drakkoths are not particularly spiritual people but they see true dragons as incarnations of ancient gods and willingly give their lives in service to these creatures. Drakkoth society also gained much of its arcane knowledge from the true dragons, owing the existence of drakkoth spellcasters largely to those dragons.

      "Rogue eidolons were created by cults worhsipping evil deities. Originally made to be inanimate idols honoring their gods and foci of worshipping rites. When a cult’s deity was pleased with its worshippers and their offerings, it sent a spark of life to animate the statue as a reward for its followers’ services. The newly animated eidolon would be a powerful defender of its cult and in its own right a servant of the god that infused it with false life. Enraged Idols. Fuelled by the malevolence of the god that gave it life, such an eidolon would rule the cult with an iron fist and as over time it would slowly go mad, its greed increased. Once a cult could no longer meet its demand, the eidolon would finally snap into a frenzied rage, slaughtering the worshippers in a blind fury. Roaming Monsters. Unlike hallowed eidolons, most rogue eidolons become completely consumed by their thirst for sacrifices and spend the rest of their unlimited lifespan in a blind frenzy. They do not look for new worshippers to make sacrifices, but just for more sacrifices they will make to themselves. They wander aimlessly, attacking anything they come across with the sole intent of slaughtering everything in their own glory. Though they usually wander around and attack any living creature on sight, their insanity makes rogue eidolons unpredictable. Some continue to preside over their slaughtered cult’s hallowed ground, worshipped only by the corpses of those it slaughtered long ago. Others may completely ignore a potential victim, believing it to be a worshipper that managed to please the eidolon in the past. The eidolons’ madness literally oozes from the constructs. The symbols on their faces drip thick blood that causes those touched by it to be infected by the eidolon’s frenzy and to attempt to slaughter anyone they see, even close friends and family members. Even strikes from the eidolon’s fists will cause a target to lose its lucidity and its ability to tell friend from foe.",
      "Equiceph Large, equine humanoids, equicephs have the head of a horse complete with a flowing mane and stand on two hooved legs. Their muscular arms have humanoid hands and their entire bodies are covered in sleek, short fur, which runs the same gamut of colors as that of wild mustangs. Slave Drivers. Equicephs are merciless, warmongering slavers, staging raids from their forest homes to take captives in nearby hills and open plains. They often go for hobgoblin slaves, which are small enough to push around and used to following orders. These goblinoids are far from their only slaves however. Equicephs are not picky and will enslave any creature that allows itself to be captured and coerced by the horse-folk. Remnants of a Greater People. Not all equicephs are as tyrannical as the ones encountered in these lands. In fact, the equicephs commonly encountered are merely descendants of the worst criminals of the equiceph race, which have a long time ago been exiled from their civilization. The original equiceph civilization is said to have been wiped out by a demonic incursion. Once a prosperous people on a distant continent across the ocean to the west, its peaceful society is now history. Their exiles were sent away to continue their ways away from the lands of their kind. These criminals raised new generations under their merciless, corrupt rule system, becoming a wandering tribe of slavers and raiders."

While within roughly 50 miles of its queen, a formian can instantly share all experiences and information with any other member of its colony. The queen instantly relays orders this way and can impeccably coordinate the colony and have the entirety of its children react as needed to whatever as few as one of them experiences. Relentless Expansion. Formian empires are relentlessly dedicated to expanding and spreading their colonies and their order. To this end they attack all other creatures that resist their expansion. Defeated enemies are not killed if it can be helped but instead put to work in building and expanding formian cities. While higher classes of formians are capable of speech and understand the Common language, it is futile to negotiate with an invading formian force. Their only goal is to grow and impose their order everywhere, so the only response that has any chance of stopping their expansion is force of arms.

      "Frost salamanders are intelligent and malevolent predators roaming icy regions all over the world. They resemble serpentine lizards with six legs, ice-blue, mottled skin and teeth and claws reminiscent of icicles, both in shape and their translucent and even partially clear quality. Their bodies radiate freezing cold in close proximity which they use to sap their victims’ energy and to freeze defeated prey. A mature forst salamander is roughly ten feet long from nose to tail, but the creatures do not stop growing after reaching adulthood, potentially growing to rival ancient dragons, both in size and sheer power. Frost salamanders spend most of their lives alone, although once they found a partner for mating, they share their lair with their mate for a time. Typically, the male will allow the female into its lair and share its preserved food in exchange for the privilege of mating with the female. The young will leave the lair early on to fend for themselves. Sure-Footed. The feet of frost salamanders are particularly adapted toward moving on icy surfaces. They never loose grip even on smooth ice surfaces and can climb glacier walls and",

It can climb ice surfaces, such as a glacier wall or even ceiling without needing to make an ability check.",
      "even the ceilings of icy caves with the same ease geckos might scale stone walls. They use this advantage when hunting, driving prey onto slippery surfaces, where it is slowed and has difficulty maneuvering and responding to the salamanders’ attack. Frozen Food. Frost salamanders are omnivorous but have a preference for meat. They tend not to eat their prey directly upon making a catch. Instead they drag the body back to their lairs where they freeze the catch, not eating until all warmth has left the body. If prey is plentiful, a frost salamander might even keep particularly uncommon and delectable prey frozen in its lair for years on end, waiting for the right moment when the craving for this particular meal strikes them. As a result, a frost salamander’s lair can sometimes contain the frozen bodies of adventurers or travelling merchants, still with a wealth of gold, jewelry or high quality gear on them."

Some tribal folk living in the frozen wastes collect these eggs and train the hatchlings from young age to help and protect the community and even to be ridden as mounts. This however requires exceptional insulation against their freezing cold bodies, usually in the form of saddles treated with magic that protects against the cold. Hatred of Remorhazes. It is often debated whether frost worms are related to purple worms or remorhazes or, indeed, neither of the two. What is known is that frost worms and remorhazes frequently attack each other on sight, fighting to the death. These confrontations are devastating to large areas and frequently won by the remorhazes, which are more both physically superior and have a distinct advantage over their heat-sensitive opponents due to their exceptionally hot bodies and breath attacks, while being immune to the worm’s otherwise deadly cold.",

They are perpetually surrounded by a thin, swirling fog which at closer examination reveals the forms of tormented faces, screaming in fear and pain, constantly emerging and then dissolving again. Unholy Bargain. Death Giants weren’t always the same creatures they are known as today. Once better known as ash giants (a name still used in some places), they possessed a great and proud civilization which was headed for destruction by a force now lost to history. In order to preserve their empire, the ash giants struck a bargain with unholy forces. They gave up the souls of every one of their kind in exchange for the power to save their empire. In return they were granted the power of the Plane of Negative Energy. Granting them limited magic abilities and the power to entrap souls and bind them to themselves, growing in power in the process. The deal they struck was a poor one, their empire crumbled, though the giants survived, but their souls are now bound without exception for obliteration on the Negative Energy Plane. Soul Stealers. Death giants are constantly surrounded by a vortex of souls, so thick it is visible to nonmagical senses. When a death giant kills a creature, its soul is absorbed into this vortex. These souls guard the giant from harm and their horrific wailing can strike unnatural fear. Arcane Complacency. After their empire fell, the death giants were left with the destroyed remnants of their past. Rather than rebuilding, they made do with their fate, living in the ruins of their former civilization, they came to rely on the magical abilities given to them by their bargain. Their culture was gradually lost to the past and their physical skills atrophied from disuse. Despite this, even today death giants are among the most formidable giants to face as foes.",

It is unknown whether they emigrated from the Prime at some point, or actually originated in the world of the Fey. Those who support the former theory often hypothesize that wild giants were the result of some sort of union between frost giants and storm giants, changed by the strange nature of the feywild, while others posit some relation to the firbolg which is evidenced by cultural similarities between them and a mutual connection to the fey. Wild giants are unusually small for true",

Wild giants do not submit to the structure of the Ordning that other true giants follow, and reject the authority of the Storm King. Instead, in their Feywild home, they serve the fey lords as hunters aiding in the Wild Hunt, a rare event signifying a trial of destiny for a particularly powerful mortal, chosen by the Master of the Hunt. Though even when their masters are not on the hunt wild giants will organize their own hunts, purely for the sake of sport. Wild giants live for the hunt and consider themeselves the embodiments of the power of the untamed wild. Beast Bond. A wild giant who distinguishes itself as an especially skilled warrior is chosen to become a beast speaker. A beast speaker embodies a bestial path that is largely informed by the giant’s skills and personality. Upon having chosen a path, the giant is granted magical abilities befitting its chosen beast, among them the ability to speak to and understand the animals the speaker embodies. On the wild giants’ hunts, beast speakers fulfill special roles based on their paths. This system is unique among the cultures of true giants, making wild giants’ skill sets and abilities much more varied and giving them the ability to cooperate more effectively than most other giants.",

Fighting with the ferocity of an enraged bear, they are capable of literally manifesting their beast bond, using the enchanted bearskins they wear to transform themselves into giant bears.

When the prey has been found, the huntmasters mark it for their allies and attack with grand charges.",
      "Ravenspeaker The ominous ravenspeakers are bound to the midnight-colored birds, capable of flying on wings of darkness and summoning great swarms of their winged beast-kin. Ravenspeakers are the stealthiest and most mobile among wild giants, it is their task to allow the hunting party to travel unnoticed, to approach unwary prey and destroy it with a single decisive strike. The great flocks of ravens they call to their aid serve to harass and distract the prey as the ravenspeakers bring their war picks to bear with deadly precision."

The guardian spirits can be suppressed by a cleric’s turn undead, a paladin’s turn the unholy ability, or similar abilities. When the death giant is in the area of effect or becomes the target of such an ability, it must make a Charisma saving throw against the ability’s save DC. On a failed save the giant’s guardian spirits are suppressed for the duration of the ability. While they are suppressed the giant loses its immunity to necrotic damage, does not benefit from the advantage the guardian spirits provide, from steal soul and cannot use its frightful keening. If the frightful keening is already in effect, it immediately ends. The death giant can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      "The apelike girallons are not all created equally, some among them are smarter and stronger than the average, thought to have purposefully been created as leaders. Among girallons, some individuals are set apart by a more developed secondary pair of arms. While common girallons have one pair of arms that is proportionate to their size, when compared to the most comparable type of apes, gorillas, and a secondary pair of slightly, but noticably shorter arms. On the leader specimens, both pairs of arms are fully developed. They are further set apart by patches of fur along their limbs and stomach area consisting of long strands of hair, which almost invoke images of a bard wearing a particularly gaudy shirt, decorated with rows of long tassels. These girallons are the dominant males and females in a troop of girallons and accordingly are usually referred to as girallon alphas. Girallon alphas are stronger and more intelligent than their common relatives. They can use their more developed arms to hurl large rocks at enemies and prey. Undisputable Leaders. Some girallon alphas spend the majority of their lives on their own, only finding company to mate and reproduce while others join troops of other girallons. Few girallon alphas even wander the wild alone until they come across a troop of natural great apes, most commonly gorillas. Whether it joins a troop of girallons or other apes, the girallon alpha will quickly establish its dominance over the tribe, this is regardless of the aplha’s sex. Despite many apes’ alpha leaders normally being male, even female girallon alphas will establish their dominance over the gorilla tribe by challenging the dominant male. In an ape troop, this process is almost universally quick and without fail ends with the girallon taking over, due to its savage ferocity as well as its physical and mental superiority over its opponent. In a girallon tribe the alpha may have a more difficult time establishing dominance, it is still stronger and more intelligent than a common girallon and will more often succeed than not. Once established as the leader, a girallon alpha will not allow its dominance to be further challenged, fighting any contender to the death if need be. Despite this kind of takeover by a different species, having a girallon leader tends to be a beneficial change for an ape troop, as the girallon is a more intelligent leader and effective hunter than any of the apes and is capable of being, and sometimes it single-handedly fights off rival troops and other threats. Even some tribes of humanoids revere the mighty girallon alphas. Although these savage tribes do not have girallons as leaders, they believe the alphas to be spiritual gatekeepers. When their hunters grow old, rather than suffering infirmity and withering away, they seek out a girallon alpha in a ritualistic hunt, which is bound to grant them a worthy death Cross-Species Reproduction. Girallons are capable of mating with natural gorillas and producing fertile offspring. A union between the two species has roughly a 25% chance of resulting in a girallon offspring, otherwise the child will be a gorilla, showing no obvious outward signs of its relation with the girallon, it can however occur that the child of two gorillas with girallon ancestry turns out to be a purebred girallon. When such a girallon is born into a troop not including a living adult girallon, it will usually take over leadership as soon as it matures rather than striking out on its own as girallons born to others of their kind usually do.",

      "Gray Render Gray renders are bestial predators found in the remote wilderness. They are infamous for their savagery and power. Their skin resembles that of a large pachyderm, like a rhino or elephant. However, they are bipedal creatures, more ape-like in shape. Their fang-filled maws, clawed hands and feet, and six eyes give them a distinctive appearance. Powerful Jaws. Gray renders are known for the prodigious bite force they can exert. Their jagged teeth can establish a strong hold on almost anything, allowing them to even uproot and tear apart large trees of up to 3 feet diameter. Their name derives from their tendency to capture prey with their fangs and tear it to pieces between their teeth and claws. Solitary Sovereigns. Gray renders avoid their own kind at all times. A gray render establishes its territory by destroying trees in distinctive patterns, marking its presence to other renders and usually driving potential rivals away. Only rarely is a gray render desparate enough to try to take over another render’s territory violently. The trail of rent trees also serves as a potent warning to travellers and adventurers, alarming them to the presence of a gray render in the area and often leading to the relocation of trade routes. Hunters avoid hunting grounds that show signs of inhabitation by a gray render. Gray renders reproduce asexually, carrying a single young in a pouch for a time, until it is mature enough to fend for itself, upon which the young leaves the parent’s territory and seeks out its own. A gray render typically produces only one offspring during its lifetime."

Whether its adopted charges accept it or not, a gray render attempts to stay close, watching over them and bringing daily offerings of meat. It never harms its fosterlings. Even if they attack it, the gray render will opt to retreat rather than fight back. It will return later to continue watching over its charges.

These rare and expensive components are almost impossible to acquire, unless the grisgol’s creators are capable of enchanting the items themselves. The most important component of a grisgol however is a lich’s phylactery, functioning as the construct’s heart and animating it. Some liches who can afford to aquire or create enough enchanted gear to construct a grisgol do so to form an animate shell for their phylactery that gives it the ability to defend itself from attackers when the lich itself is not able to protect it.

Most of a gulgar’s senses are dull and unreliable, however its hearing is keen and picks up a wide range of sound, well beyond that of most other creatures. Gulgars can even sense vibrations in the ground, allowing them to pinpoint the position of invisible foes. Gulgars’ voices are so low pitched as to be inaudible to creatures that don’t share their exceptional hearing ability. The notable exception to this is when a gulgar uses its sonic pulse ability, which produces the distinctive “guhlgaar” sound that earned the creatures the name they are known by on the Material Plane. Yrthak Tamers. Arriving to the Material Plane, the gulgars encountered yrthaks (see page 205), flying creatures with a similar reliance on sound for orientation and offense. Gulgars found that they were uniquely able to exploit yrthaks’ keen hearing with their powerful voices, granting them influence over the flying creatures and allowing them to tame the beasts for use as flying steeds.

Harbinger beasts resemble emaciated buffalo with long, serpentine necks and horned heads with gaunt humanoid faces, drawn into an expression resembling a tragedian’s mask. Manes of raven hair hang lifelessly from the length of their necks and backs. A harbinger beast’s very aspect tells of hardship and grief and its arrival is an unmistakable omen of calamity.

They feed on despair, pride, and woe, a diet of vitriolic emotions that causes their very breath to become poison.

      "The bizarre spiderlike creature known as the harpoon spider is a subterranean predator that hunts by shooting its fangs through its prey and drawing it in by a long sinew connecting the fang to the spider’s face. Its carapace is covered in razor-sharp spines on which the creature can impale its victims using its long, flexible legs ending in small prehensile claws. Harpoon spiders are not true spiders, at least not anymore, having originally been created by experiments conducted on monstrous spiders that transformed the creatures into this even more dangerous form. Spider Kinship. Harpoon spiders associate with other monstrous spiders and similar creatures, such as ettercaps, typically gaining some sort of leader status for their greater power and higher intelligence. The harpoon spider itself benefits from the lesser creatures’ company as an additional layer of defense for its lair. Sadistic Humor. Harpoon spiders have a cruel sense of humor and enjoy playing with victims, impaling them on their spines to slowly die, and allowing them a chance to escape, only to catch them with their harpoon fangs again. Even after the prey died, a harpoon spider often plays with the remains from time to time while the meat ripens toward just the right amount of decay to be perfect for consumption. Bite.

The frontal half of their gaunt bodies is covered in long spines not unlike those of a porcupine, only much thicker and longer. Howling Beasts. The bestial appearance of howlers belies their intelligence. They typically hunt in packs and seem to communicate using their howls in some way that has not been possible to decipher for other creatures, even using magic. They also appear to be able to understand Abyssal but lack the ability to speak the language. Whichever the case may be, howlers are capable of coordinating fairly complex assaults, involving swift hit-and-run attacks, charging in to bite a target and then implant some of its quills on the pass. The pack continuously harrows its prey from multiple angles, forcing the prey to move to the howlers’ whim, until every enemy has been whittled down enough to deliver the death blow. Before the actual attacks, howler packs often spend hours or even days terrorizing their prey from afar, skirting humanoid communities howling day and night. The sound of their howling robbing their victims of proper rest and driving them slowly mad. The fiends’ howls are even capable of rending the victims’ minds with enough exposure. If such a howler infestation is not dealt with in time, it can incapacitate an entire village over the course of a few days without the howlers ever making contact with any of the villagers. Once they think their victims are sufficiently weakened, the howlers will move in to finish their prey off. Abyssal Warhounds. Howlers are sometimes trained by Medium or Small creatures of the Abyss, such as lesser demons or abyssal orcs (see the Abyssal Creature template in Appendix C: Templates on page 234) to serve as guard and attack beasts, as well as mounts and beasts of burden. Larger and more powerful demons like to employ howlers as hunting dogs. Although they are intelligent and able to understand Abyssal, howlers still need training to carry a rider, and creatures wanting to ride a howler require specialized training to avoid accidents involving the howler’s wicked quills.",

  "Howler Wasp": {
    "Excess": [
      "When one is seeking to create a suitable creature to guard one’s wizard’s tower, magically crossing wasps with an especially irritable species of apes might not be the best idea. This thought did not cross the mind of the wizard who created the first howler wasps to protect his abode. Resembling oversized wasps with vaguely apish heads and a pair of long limbs ending in hook-like claws, howler wasps are just as vicious and unpleasant as they look. Hive Spires. Colonies of howler wasps start as small nests constructed of earth and plant matter mixed with secretions from the wasps constructed as a small, vaguely spherical shelter for the queen. As the swarm grows, additional cells are added around the queen’s chamber, removing the queen further from direct access to the outside as the hive expands. At a cerain point the nest is extended more upward than outward, resulting in the hive structure slowly taking the form of a misshapen spire easily as tall as five to seven stories of a human building or even more. The howler wasps usually seal off entrances near the ground to prevent non-flying creatures from entering their nest, though sometimes the seals are flawed and can be broken open with enough muscle strength, allowing for an easy entrance near the queen. Exploring the entire nest however can yield unexpected rewards, as howler wasp nests often have the gear of slain foes embedded in their walls, which the wasps used as building material. Instinctive Tactics. Howler wasps hunt in swarms of half a dozen or more, depending on the size of the colony, searching for food within a few miles of their hive structures, seeing any animate creature that is not part of their own colony as potential prey. When finding such prey, the howler wasps will attack anything in sight, each wasp going after whichever target is closest, regardless of size or how menacing it might look. As soon as one howler wasp is killed, it sprays its killer with a pheromone that enrages its fellow wasps, sending them into a frenzy and causing them to gang up the doused creature and not let off until it is killed. Once a doused creature is slain, the swarm will go back to attacking randomly until the next howler dies. This usually means that an attacking howler wasp swarm will inevitably take casualties when fighting prey that can defend itself, but the most dangerous opponent tends to be taken care of first and the howler wasps continue whittling down their enemies, strongest ones first. Once the prey is brought down, the howler wasps proceed to tear apart any pieces too large to carry at once and begin transporting the meat back to their hive, inciting more wasps to follow and help retrieving the food.",
      "Howler Wasp Queen Most howler wasps are male, the few that are born female are universally capable of becoming a queen. This makes them a potential threat to the reigning queen, and so she makes sure to have any other female growing beyond the worker stage killed in order to prevent it from challenging her position. Some females manage to evade this fate and flee the nest, eventually starting another colony, becoming queens of their own hives. As long as she remains undisturbed, the queen will spend its entire life in its chamber at the center of the howler wasp hive where she lays between thirty and sixty eggs a month, nursing them in her chamber together with a host of male workers. After about a week, a fully developed, worker-sized howler wasp hatches from the egg and immediately begins serving its funtion in the colony. If a howler wasp queen dies, the other females are at freedom to grow and become queens themselves. The first females to grow large enough will enter into a deadly competition, slaughtering each other and any smaller females until only one is left to claim heirdom of the colony and start laying her own eggs. The males will accept the new queen instinctively once all potential competitors are defeated.",
      "Howler Wasp Warrior Warriors are a breed of howler wasp distinguished from the regular worker caste mainly by their significantly greater size.

Howling echoes usually spawn in regions, where winter nights are long, and only appear on cold nights. They return to take vengeance for their deaths and will hunt down any living creature they come across, even after those who initially wronged them are long dead.

It will also try to move around physical barriers and other creatures and never willingly phase through them despite being theoretically capable.

When doing this, the krenshar screeches a high pitched sound, adding to the effect, triggering primal fears in most creatures observing the krenshar. Prides. Krenshars are not very different from most cats in behavior, though they are very social among their own kind. They live in prides of varying size, usually ranging between half a dozen and two dozen. The prides make their lairs near simple shelters, usually under a rock outcropping, dense tree coverage or in a shallow cave. Most krenshars in the group that are capable of contributing during hunts have the right to mate and a pride usually contains roughly half as many cubs as it does adults. Cunning Hunters. Krenshars are highly intelligent. When hunting for food, the pack sends out a few scouts to circle their prey and drive it toward the bulk of the pride, who wait in ambush.

      "Kruthiks are creatures that resulted from magical experiments, presumably attempting to combine features of infernal creatures, insects and some reptilian or possibly dinosaur, with the aim to create highly effective and social predators, presumably for use in warfare. While the experiments did indeed produce formidable predators, one crucial element was missing. As such schemes are wont to end up, the monsters turned out to be uncrontrollable and scattered into the wild, integrating, rather violently, into the natural ecosystem. Subterranean Colonies. Kruthiks are highly social and form swarms not unlike those of ants or bees, although they don’t form around a single breeding female, but all fully grown kruthiks of the colony breed. Their nests are complex tunnel networks they burrow into solid earth where they nurse their eggs and take prey to be consumed. A kruthik is deadly in each stage of its life, even a newly hatched specimen will immediately leave the nest and start foraging. When it is ready for metamorphosis it will retreat to the nest and wrap itself in a cocoon to undergo the change into the basic adult form, becoming significantly more powerful when it hatches from its cocoon, it spends a significantly longer portion of its lifespan in this form than in hatchling form and many kruthiks die a violent death in this stage, making them the most numerous kruthiks in the colony. If the adult kruthik survives long enough and grows sufficiently, it will undergo a second metamorphosis, becoming a greater kruthik. The greater kruthiks are the most powerful form and are capable of breeding. Methodical Predation. A kruthik nest is never permanent. The swarm eventually exhausts an area of all possible prey and then moves on, building a new nest and systematically hunting all available prey in the new territory. They do however take the death of their own kind very seriously and will take the lingering scent of dead kruthiks as a warning that the area is more dangerous to the swarm than the prospective prey might be worth, effectively freeing the area from further kruthik infestation for a long time, if not permanently. Infernal Relation. Kruthiks are similar in demeanor and temperament to the devils with whom they share ancestry and have a rudimentary grasp of their language. Some theories say kruthiks were in fact created by devils and intentionally released upon the Material Plane. They have been observed cooperating with devils and those who associate with them. A large scale devil invasion can easily stir nearby kruthik colonies into aggressive action, causing the creatures to instinctively attack alongside their infernal relatives.",

      "When the consciousness of a powerful spellcaster is filled with enough hate to hold on to its body well after death, it can take over the very worms consuming the spellcaster’s rotting flesh. This mass of vermin then rises as a swarm imitating the spellcaster’s former shape, known as a larva mage. Monsters in Life, Monsters in Death. A spellcaster does not become a larva mage simply by virtue of being a powerful wielder of magic. Those who do become larva mages, were hateful beings, using their vast power to enslave, terrorize and opress in life. These spellcasters become jealous and powerful enough that their souls refuse to let go of their rotting bodies even in death, as worms consume their flesh. Such a soul attracts the attention of Kyuss, the Demigod of Worms, sire of many aberrations and undead in the world, who lends them their twisted new life in a body comprised of the vermin that consumed the old one. Imitation of Life. While a larva mage is the memory of a deceased magic wielder, it is not an undead creature. Its concsciousness imposed itself on a swarm of living worms and maggots. This swarm imitates the shape the mage had in life, both out of an instinctual attachment to its previous life and out of necessity. This way the mage can continue to use its magical implements and carry its spellbook, arcane focus, and whatever else it used in life. Along with flowing robes, many larva mages wear facemasks that cover thair hideous appearance and lend them the appearance of a living humanoid at least at a distance. This serves less as a disguise than to satisfy the mage’s own vanity and to echo what little is left of its humanity, since to blend in, the larva mage can easily use magic. Vile Overlords. Larva mages add the powers of their new form to their already vast arsenal of arcane power, being resistant to magic and oozing the rot of death. A larva mage is nearly indestructible. When facing death, it will simply fall apart, the worms then flee into the closest cracks and into the earth. Once the larva mage discorporated this way, the larva mage can only be destroyed by killing every single worm that survived. If even one gets away, a few months later the larva mage will return to rebuild its empire. Their measure of power and thirst for more makes larva mages natural leaders of evil creatures. A larva mage gathers creatures around itself to serve it in whatever its schemes may be. A larva mage serves itself before anyone or anything else. While it might ally with a similarly powerful entity, such as a lich or an ancient dragon, it will not accept the authority of another creature except perhaps that of the Lord of Worms himself.",

It is a nearly unstoppable force, considered one of the legendary Elder Evils, its power matched by few creatures in the Material Plane and beyond. On top of that the re-emergence of the Worm that Walks is always accompanied by its cult of followers, consisting of mad mortal worshippers and hideous monstrosities alike. Divine Origin. Scholars generally agree that the Worm that Walks has to be the reincarnated Kyuss himself, having reformed himself the same way larva mages do. This is evidenced by the fact that the Worm is served by the same creatures created by and associated with Kyuss. Even the larva mages themselves, who normally submit to no other creature, will bow to the Worm’s enormous form and cooperate with and act as highest ranking leaders of the cults of Kyuss that serve the Worm.",

Blackscale Lizardfolk claim their scale color and their remarkable features come from an ancestry leading back to the black dragons. While their outlook is much more peaceful than that of their supposed draconic ancestors, they do inherit some of the pride and respect for power. Other than these similiarities, little evidence supporting—or much less proving—this claim exists. Proud Fighters. Blackscales are confident in their strength and refuse to apply traps and tricks, viewing such machinations as the tools of lesser, weaker creatures. The blackscales prefer to fight face to face, in an open confrontation, where their size usually serves them well. They do not attack unprovoked and will hear strangers out, but when given reason to fight, they will do so with great fervor. Left to their own devices, a group of blackscale lizardfolk fight as individuals, each trying to prove its own strength and courage, rather than working together with its companions to maximize their combat effectiveness. A capable leader may be able to force them to cooperate, albeit only for a short time, before their desire to one-up each other takes over again. Tribute Culture. Blackscales live in jungles alongside tribes of greenscale and poison dusk lizardfolk. They use their size and strength to intimidate and dominate their smaller kin coexisting in their environment. Blackscale culture is primitive, but they live off of tributes they extort out of their smaller kin, claiming these tributes are made to the dragon guardians they represent. This gives the blackscales access to weapons and armor outside of their own limited capacity for craftsmanship and their leaders, the strongest warriors among their number, wear intricate jewelry and decorations crafted by the smaller lizardfolk."

They use strategy and tactics over brute force, but frown upon the use of stealth and ambushes in battle, preferring to meet their foes in open combat. The most distinguished fighters and strategists become the leaders of sunscale fighting forces and often wear better equipment and heavier armor, causing other cultures to liken them to knights, samurai or warriors of similar status. At closer examination however, it turns out these warriors have no special social status and simply serve a function in combat that makes them more valuable targets in battle and thus requires better protection. Dragon Affinity. Most lizardfolk revere dragonkind, mostly metallic or chromatic dragons. Sunscales are no different in this regard. Among these dragons, they gravitate toward red and gold dragons, but many sunscale communities are also drawn toward the worship of sun dragons (see page 77) and can often be found in a sun dragon’s community of followers.

They are predators but regularly need to consume metal to maintain and grow their metallic spikes. Because of their dietary requirements, lodestone marauders are mainly found near rich deposits. Miners’ Bane. Constantly seeking metal deposits, lodestone marauders frequently become problems for mining communities, where they not only consume ore and even mining equipment, but kill and eat the miners as well. A marauder will make its den in the mines and collect more metallic objects in hopes of attracting a mate. If it is left unchallenged, the area will soon be infested with lodestone marauders, so the mining communities are forced to enlist help from adventurers, mercenaries, or other armed groups in order to remove the parasitic monsters. Treasure Devourers. Any type of metal makes for good nutrition for lodestone marauders, from iron to gold and even platinum. A treasure hoard exposed to an unchecked lodestone marauder will quickly be reduced to a shadow of its former self, unless the marauder decides to use it to attract a mate, giving the owner some time to find help driving off the creature.",

      "These fey are ferocious hunters that live for the thrill of the hunt. They superficially resemble a cross between a giant and an elf. Muscular and easily as tall as an ogre, they have elven facial features and light, almost translucent skin. Typically clad in ornate bronze armor and wielding equally decorated axes and shields. Indiscriminate Trophy Hunters. There is little lunar ravagers do not consider worthwhile prey. When the moon is clearly visible in the night sky and a party goes on a hunt, they fan out and comb a large area, putting about 100 feet to half a mile between each ravager. Their tracks covered by their innate magic, the hunters seek their prey. When one lunar ravager spots potential prey, anything from a simple human peasant caught in the woods at night to a great beast as powerful as a mature dragon, it will sound its horn, alerting all other members of the party to its find. The rest of the party turn invisible and follow the horn blows while the spotter drives its quarry toward the other ravagers, sounding its horn repeatedly to inform the party of the direction the quarry is going. When the quarry is surrounded, the ravagers attack from all sides, including above, using their fly spells. Cutting off any potential way of escape, the fey descend upon their prey and attack without mercy. Once the prey has been brought down, the ravagers take any valuable loot and their trophy, before they go back to their routine, combing the area all night. Moon Rider Lodges. Lunar ravagers travel using magic; teleporting to and from their lodges, which are built on wandering clouds and connected to the light of the moon. These lodges are usually carried by the wind, wherever it may take them, but the resident lunar ravagers do have some basic control over the direction in which the lodge travels. As long as a ravager is under moonlight, it can magically return to the nearest lunar ravager lodge and from there, it can teleport to any point within a wide radius. In their lodges, lunar ravagers recuperate from arduous hunts, socialize with their clan, and plan their next hunts before heading out again. A lunar ravager’s worth is measured in the quality of the trophies and loot they bring back to the lodge and their usefulness to the clan. They take sustenance from the lands below, raiding and hunting for food and materials they need. Avoiding large settlements and any locales which might pose a real threat to the hunting parties, they will typically raid small farming villages and such with food, ale, livestock and perhaps the odd peasant here and there, before returning to their lodge to feast and drink in celebration of a successful hunt. A clan will usually avoid staying in one place for long, as it prevents overhunting an area and keeps their victims off balance. The local authorities will not be able to react to the lunar ravagers’ attacks, since their arrival is hard to predict and it usually takes too much time to mount effective retaliatory measures before the ravagers move on to strike elsewhere.",

They ascend to the streets at night in search for new prey and every night more people vanish or are fround dead, from nameless beggars to night guards and citizens, even nobles out for some nightly amusement. When a meazel infestation becomes large enough, the creatures often start organizing in cults, many of which associated with Garagos the Reaver, and become bolder, their attacks aiming for larger and better protected targets. Large enough meazel cults have been reported to assault guarded temples, noble households and even guard houses of city guards. Mercenaries or adventurers hired to root out a meazel infestation have to contend with delving into the city’s sewer system to locate their lairs, and fight the creatures in these filthy conditions.

      "Half-Spawn Meenlocks form spontaneously where the feywild’s influence is strong and fear overwhelms a creature. They can also create more of their kind by congregating and continuously torturing humanoids with their telepathy, until the victim is transformed into a meenlock itself. Sometimes the telepathic ritual to create a new meenlock is interrupted before the metamorphosis is completed, or something else goes wrong. Most commonly this results in the half-formed meenlock ending up in a vegetative state. The meenlocks will dispose of the withering body in such a case and move on to find new victims. Sometimes however, the half-spawned meenlock rises with its twisted mind only partially intact. Half-Formed in Body and Mind. Meenlock half-spawn are not fully transformed, and their appearance reflects this. The creature still displays humanoid features and lacks many of the more insectoid traits fully formed meenlocks possess. Many half-spawn still have jaws lined with irregular teeth, noses and blank eyeballs. They often lack some or all of the mandibles, antennae and insectoid extra limbs common to fully formed meenlocks. Their skin, while having formed a small degree of the chitinous plates a healthy meenlock has, is still much softer and many of the quills normally covering a meenlock’s back are less developed and often more hairlike. Their pincerlike claws of a half-span are not as sharp and as a consequence less deadly. On the other hand the half-spawn are not susceptible to bright light the way their kin are. Similarly to its body, the half-spawn’s mind is not fully transformed. Half-spawn appear to still possess memories of their previous life, which are both an asset and a liability to them. When a half-spawn telepathically induces images and thoughts of terror in a humanoid, these impressions are more vivid and terrifying than what a single regular meenlock can achieve. It seems the half-spawn have a better understanding of what terrifies its victim. But this understanding comes with a cost, halfspawn are prone to random bursts of abject terror, becoming paralyzed with fear, presumably as they are reliving the torturous images of their incomplete transformation, or perhaps remembering their previous life in a moment of lucidity, and being terrified at what has become of them."

      "Wandering Tower Encounters",
      "Wandering tower encounters should always come with some planning. First off, the mimic is its own mini-dungeon. You should be sure to have a floor plan of the wandering tower’s building form, especially if you use a map for your combat encounters. This will help you and the players keep track of positions, especially if the tower uses its Stuff action. The tower may also try to cut the players off by locking down doors between them. Second, to make the encounter memorable you should think about how the wandering tower attracts its victims. Does it just pose as an empty building offering convenient shelter for the night, or does it lure with treasures? To this end, does it use other mimics to pose as treasure or mirror mimics as inhabitants and welcoming hosts? Mimics can be used in a great variety of ways to surprise players, even when they start expecting the creatures everywhere. If you have been harrowing your players with mimics for a while, a wandering tower, especially populated with a few mirror mimics can completely subvert their expectation. Many players are automatically suspicious of anything they find in the wild, especially if it seems convenient, and when they know to expect mimics, they will be suspicious of any appropriately sized object. Still they usually don’t hesitate to enter what they think is an ordinary inn. If there are actually people living there it couldn’t possibly be full of mimics. Right? Keep in mind that mimics of any kind should be used judiciously, one wandering tower may surprise your players, but if you overdo it, they simply become paranoid of everything, which may be fun for a DM, but it is important to keep the players’ enjoyment of the game at heart. And after all: you don’t want them to see the wandering tower in your next campaign coming.",
      "A group of adventurers, weary from their travels, comes upon and old, abandoned looking tower. The front door is locked and there is no response to knocking, but the rogue finds the lock is easy enough to pick. The insides are dilapidated, as you might expect, but nonetheless this would make a good, safe place to rest for the night. The group settles down. Barring the door from the inside, they come to rest. This would be the fighter’s first night’s sleep without her armor for a week. Relieved that they do not have to have a guard post up all night, they fall asleep one by one, blissfully unaware of the the eye on the mantlepiece watching them. Elder Mimics. As a mimic ages, it continuously grows. A mimic reaches maturity around the size that most mimics are known for, which allows them to effortlessly pose as treasure chests and similarly sized objects, and many of them die a violent death at that age. Some mimics however live long enough to grow well past these proportions. These mimics become so large that they need to pose as entire buildings. Most commonly imitating lone spires, these mimics are known as wandering towers, although they are known to also imitate other types of buildings, such as farm houses and other small abodes. A very few mimics are rumored to have grown so enormous that they can pose as manor houses or even entire castles. Many wandering towers harbor common mimics as well as the more rare mirror mimics and even some trappers (See Volo’s Guide to Monsters p. 194) in their interior to help lure in and bring down prey, sharing the spoils with these creatures. Mirror mimics often make travellers feel more welcome and at ease, as an inhabited building may look less suspicious than an empty one, and even adventurers well aware of the possibility that any unattended object could be a mimic often don’t know of mirror mimics capable of impersonating people. The mirror mimics sometimes search the surrounding area for people they may be able to invite to stay in their “home”. A wandering tower is usually accompanied by a swarm of scavenging blood ravens (see Appendix A: Miscellaneous Creatures on page 222), roosting on its roof and watching and waiting for food. The flocks of red birds can lend the tower an ominous atmosphere and potentially give the creature away to those who are familiar with these mimics. If any of the wandering tower’s captured and bloodied prey escapes its interior, the blood crazed birds descend upon them in a frenzy. Hunting Strategies. A new building mysteriously appeared down the street overnight. The people hired to investigate the suspicious phenomenon enter the building but never come out. A cozy roadside inn beckons to weary travellers passing in the evening, the innkeeper and barmaids going out of their way to make patrons feel at home. The next morning the travellers are gone without a trace. A lone wizard’s tower makes promises of arcane disoveries and magical treasure, but those seeking out its secrets and bounties never return from their expedition. A wandering tower uses whatever lures a building may be able to provide to draw potential prey inside, where its core, the mimic’s brain and heart, pulsing with pseudopods, eyes, and mouths waits to attack them disguised as a piece of the furnishing. While the wandering tower’s core is its most vulnerable spot, the tower must rely on trapping prey on its inside, because it is too slow to give chase. On its inside, the mimic’s core is the only part able to attack and kill prey, so the wandering tower has to expose itself to this potential risk. The core is extremely powerful and resilient nonetheless, making all but the most experienced and powerful adventurers easy prey. Creatures that manage to escape from the fight and somehow break open the door to the outside will likely attract the attention of the hungry swarms of blood ravens on the mimic’s roof. On top of that, the mimic’s form uses its pseudopods to capture prey and stuff it back inside through another door or window, into another locked room, where the core can come for it. Tombs of Treasure. During its lifetime, a mimic successful enough to grow to become a wandering tower kills and consumes many carelss adventurers. Eventually growing large enough to take the shape of an entire building, their prey usually dies inside their shape, leaving any magic items or treasure they were carrying in the mimics body. A group of adventurers lucky, or powerful enough to slay a wandering tower is likely to find great riches inside its amorphous flesh, once the dying mimic has collapsed into its fully amorphous form.",

The core can’t leave the building and is immune to any effect that would transport it out of the tower but it can move through the inside at a speed of 30 feet and pass through interior objects without resistance. If the core ends its move inside an object, the obstacle is shoved aside. If its move ends inside a wall, enough of the core’s form stands out both sides of the wall for creatures to be able to attack it without it gaining cover. The core can move up the mimic’s walls as though it had a 30-foot climb speed. The wandering tower may move and have its core move on the same turn.

Even when a creature manages to resist the paralyzing effect of the horrid organ, the mohrg’s bony hands are capable of seizing a target, digging their claws into its flesh. Once it has a victim in its grasp, the mohrg will focus on its victim and kill it before moving on to the next. Undead Murderers. Mass murderers who die without atoning for their crimes may rise again as the grotesque mohrgs. These creatures are consumed by a burning hatred of all living things, and will only kill even more indiscriminately in death than they did in life, as they vainly long to live again. These undead retain memories of their past lives, the delight of hearing the screams of their victims, and seeing the life draining from their eyes. Some also remember their favored hideouts and “hunting grounds” and will return there to continue the sinister work they used to do in life. Such mohrgs sometimes will even cloak themselves in coats and capes, carrying the weapons they used when they were alive. Such disguises hardly hide their nature, but certainly make them less easy to spot at a glance. Mohrgs will likely spawn in places where dangerous criminals are executed, especially if the remains are not properly interred. In such a place, multiple mohrgs may be found, these creatures band together, overwhelming their executioners and turning them into their undead servants, leaving little more than an abandoned dungeon populated by nothing but undead abominations that seek more victims.

The nagpas proved their worth in the war against the gods, wreaking havoc on the forces of the gods with trickery and seduction. Nonetheless the primordials fought a losing war, and as it became apparent that their cause was lost, their scheming servants turned against them. The nagpas struck deals with the gods to betray their former masters. Their treachery was discovered however, and the primordials cursed their former servants for the betrayal. The curse transformed the nagpas into the hideous creatures they are today and gave them an insatiable craving for wealth and bodily comforts. Nagpas abhor their hideous appearance and are quick to smash any mirror that would force them to lay eyes on their own countenance. Curse of Greed.

Each mirror and similarly reflective surface is a connection point to the Plane of Mirrors, home of a race of creatures known as nerra; humanoid creatures with reflective, smooth skin like the surface of a mirror. Watchers in the Mirror. The nerra observe the Material Plane through the many mirrors that connect their world to ours. They sometimes cross the border between the worlds to infiltrate societies of the material plane and gather information usually about influential individuals only to abduct those people later. Some theorize their activities in the material plane serve to set up an invasion from the Plane of Mirrors. Class Society. Nerra see themselves as inherently superior to other beings, while balancing on a narrow edge morally, always struggling to keep a neutral outlook. They are lead by the Sillit class, who coordinate their activities and manage information gathered. Varoots serve primarily as infiltrators who most commonly explore and scout the Material Plane. Kalareem are the armed force, most adept at wielding the shard blades all nerra carry. Shard Swords. Nerra forge their deadly mirror-like blades from the essence of the plane of mirrors.

      "When describing a Nixie, one may be wont to say they are to merfolk as pixies are to elves. If nothing else, this at least paints an accurate picture of these tiny aquatic fey’s appearance. In place of insect wings, nixies have a set of large fins like those of flying fish and in place of legs possess a fish tail in the same way merfolk do. Uncertain Origins. Various legends surround the origin of the nixies, all of which may quite possibly be wrong. Some say they were born of a union between merfolk and pixies while others believe a beligerent fey noble once punished a group of pixies for their irritating pranks by magically combining them with fish. The most widespread story tells of a circle of particularly curious pixies who roamed the feywild in search of new sights to see. These pixies one day found themselves at the shore of a great lake or perhaps the sea. Having never seen so much water before, they wanted to know what they would find beneath the waves. But even those among the tiny fey who knew how to swim could barely fight against the waves and dive deeper than a few inches before being pushed back to the surface. All their curiosity got them was soaked wings. A creature emerged from the waves, wondering what the tiny fey were trying to accomplish, as it looked almost like they were trying to drown themselves. The pixies explained to the creature their plight. They implored the creature to help them if it could, in any way. The creature obliged, transforming the fey into the nixies they are known as today. At first the pixies were elated to be able to explore the waves but soon they realized that their perceived benefactor had disappeared, leaving them in their transformed state. If this story is true, today—generations later—nixies harbor no bitterness for the change that was made to their ancestors, but are quite happy with who they are. Water Dwellers, Land Roamers. Nixies like to spend extended periods of time outside the water, exploring the lands around the rivers, lakes and seashores they inhabit. While they are all but immobile on the ground, having to drag themselves forward, mostly with their hands, their large flying-fish-like fins serve them as wings. These wings are fully capable of sustained flight, not just gliding, and nixies out of water travel almost exclusively airborne. Usually they are encountered near the bodies of water they make their homes, but some nixies leave their home waters behind altogether, travelling overland almost their entire lives. Only occasionally they dive into ponds or even city fountains, when a yearning for water overcomes them. These roaming nixies are a strange sight to most passersby, being so adapted to life in water they stand out from the land-living creatures they mingle with. Cunning Trickery. Nixies are just as fond of playing tricks and pranks as their pixie cousins, though their tricks usually involve water, be it splashing their hapless victims or causing them to fall into water. Nixie pranks are usually harmless, and even if one turns out to be more dangerous than intended, their innate magic usually contains a way or two, of saving the subject, even if that means transforming it into a gold fish to keep it from drowning, which just adds to the nixies’ amusement. Unlike pixies, nixies are not opposed to defending themselves. They have little in the way of attack, even with their magic, but they often find creative ways to use it to outsmart and fend off an attacker."

Hidden deep within the blackest pits where nothing seems to exist other than darkness, and even demons fear to tread, the obyrith, in some worlds known as qliphoth and often believed to be a subset of demonkind, have lingered for eons. Long before the first mortals were created and perhaps even before the gods came about, the obyrith are thought to have existed within the deepest recesses of the Abyss. They are not created from the spirits of deceased mortals, but seem to be born from the darkness itself. Some say that at the very bottoms of their pits these creatures spawn from writhing carpets of flesh, claws, teeth and tentacles. Hatred of Demons. As creatures of the Abyss, the obyrith are often thought to be related to the much more well known and understood demons. The obyrith however seem to view the creatures inhabiting the upper reaches of their once uncontested domain as a verminous infestation. Some scholars believe the obyrith seek to eradicate these vermin by destroying all mortal life, and with it the sin that nourishes their Abyssal enemies. Others however hold that the obyrith have always waited for some enigmatic sign to pour forth from their tenebrous depths at the edges of existence and into the Material Plane to bring an ultimate end to not just the world but reality itself, and demonkind is merely an obstacle on their way. Whatever the truth, obyrith come into violent conflict with demons whenever they cross paths and always leave a trail of death and destruction in their path. Insanity Incarnate. To lay eyes upon a obyrith is to invite madness to one’s mind. If a obyrith presents itself and projects its bizarre and unnatural appearance, it can cause an onlooker anything from nausea to permanent obsessions or even rend a creature’s psyche asunder, destroying its mind completely. Those who worship obyrith are usually either ignorant of their masters’ goals, or some form of insanity has convinced them of the nobleness of the obyrith purpose. Kuo-toa who have not taken to worshipping their own made-up deities often worship Dagon, Prince of the Depths and other aquatic obyrith lords.",
      "Avathu The avathu is an enormous predator, surprisingly stealthy for a creature of its size, that has six stalk-like legs doubling as wings, its body covered in spines and ending in a mass of stingered tentacles at one end and a head strewn with beady eyes and a fang filled maw at the other. Its sticky saliva melts and rots flesh, weakening the avathu’s prey and making it easier to consume. Once the avathu has consumed enough flesh, it gives birth to a ysolith, a strangely twisted and inverted version of its own already strange physiology, which while smaller is even more powerful than the avathu itself.",
      "Bhasylit These diminutive obyrith often accompany greater obyrith in groups and can sometimes be found serving obyrith worshippers as familiars. Their tentacles produce a semi-sentient gluelike mucus which feeds off of creatures the obyrith touches, rapidly reproducing and covering the victim in an instant. The mucus continues feeding on the victim and hardens into an elastic web that holds it restrained, making it easy prey for the bhasylit’s more powerful kin, if only for a moment.",
      "Cyoturma The cyoturma spreads the corruption of the deepest Abyss wherever it slithers and flops. The horrific maw at its bottom drips with a self-reproducing yellowish poison that rots its victims and constantly seeps from their bodies. Unlike most obyrith, a cyoturma does not prefer killing but instead uses its venomous touch against victims that cannot meaningfully defend against the obyrith to spread its corrupting poison which eventually places victims under the sway of the obyrith.",
      "Ekolid Ekolids resemble a fusion of skulls with insectile limbs and wings and a fleshy eggsac attached to the rear, with winding stinger tails. They inject their eggs into other creatures, where the offspring hatch within moments and burst from the victim’s skin. An ekolid’s body resembles the skulls of the host species it hatched from.",
      "Isaati Little more than a tangle of intestines, filled with digestive acids and fanged orifices at the ends, wrapping around a single central maw, isaatis are scavengers that feed on anything left behind by other inhabitants of the abyss, but particularly delight in consuming the living. Isaatis are created by the immense inoqua from the corrupted bodies of living victims.",
      "Obyrith as Warlock Patrons",
      "Obyrith are atypical fiends: Unlike most fiends, which thrive in the fiery pits of the lower planes, obyriths live in the cold darkness of the deepest fathoms of the Abyss and don’t share the typical affinity to fire. If a player chooses an obyrith as their warlock patron, both the Great Old One and the Fiend are appropriate. Consider allowing the player to replace all fire-based spells, abilities and eldritch invocations granted by the Fiend with cold damage dealing versions of those same abilities. Simply change the damage type of the ability or spell and reflavor it to be cold based. For example, a fireball spell could become an explosion of frost. Instead of the usual options, a bhasylit would be an appropriate familiar for the Pact of the Chain."

While charmed, the creature must obey the nethui’s telepathic or verbal commands. The nethui must maintain concentration on its charm. It can concentrate on up to 3 charmed creatures at a time.

Their flesh grafts may look disturbing but can augment a subject’s abilities and are valued among the fiendish hordes. Unlike most obyrith who despise the demons of the upper Abyss, sibiriexes are occasionally found in their service, most often as slaves that augment the flesh of the demonic fighting forces. Even left to its own will, a sibiriex often applies grafts to its servants, or even itself, be it as a reward for their services or just to turn them into more efficient tools of the sibiriex’s will.

When using the attack action or a multiattack to make melee attacks, the creature can make an unarmed strike or attack with a one-handed weapon wielded in that hand in addition to any other attacks it makes. Weapon attacks other than unarmed strikes made with this arm have disadvantage on the attack roll, because the small hand cannot wield weapons properly. Additionally, the creature has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple another creature. Grappling Tentacle. The grafted creature gains an additional tentacle that helps it grab targets. The creature has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple another creature and a creature grappled by the grafted creature is restrained until the grapple ends. Long Arm. The grafted creature gains an overly long arm. Melee attacks made with this arm (either spell attacks or weapon attacks made with weapons wielded in that arm’s hand) add 5 feet to their reach. If the creature has a natural weapon attached to that arm with which it can make multiple attacks as part of a multiattack, only one of those attacks benefit from the extra reach. Springing Leg. The grafted creature gains an extremely long, bent leg. Its walking speed is reduced by 5 feet due to the awkward discrepancy between its legs but automatically succeeds on Strength (Athletics) checks made to jump any distance it can move in one round. Sting Tail. The grafted creature gains an additional stingered tail. When using the attack action or a multiattack to make melee attacks, the creature can make an additional melee attack as per the usual rules for melee attacks with a reach of 5 feet that deals 1d4 piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and be poisoned for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The creature is automatically proficient with this attack. Strong Leg. The grafted creature gains a disproportionately muscular leg. The creature’s walking speed increases by 10 feet and it has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to resist exhaustion due to heavy marching or running (such as from a forced march or a chase). Whip Tail. When using the attack action or a multiattack to make melee attacks, the creature can make an additional melee attack as per the usual rules for melee attacks with a reach of 10 feet that deals 1d4 slashing damage. The target must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The creature is automatically proficient with this attack. Some sibiriexes grant these grafts as gifts to useful servants. A party of evil Player Characters may be offered abyssal grafts as a reward. As the DM, treat these grafts with a similar respect as magical artifacts. They permanently increase the overall power level of a PC and can have a significant impact, especially on mid to low level parties. Also don’t forget the impact these grafts have on social interaction. Not only do they impose disadvantage on checks, but might cause the grafted PC more trouble and cause them to be shunned or outright persecuted."

Yuan-ti couldn’t ask for a more perfect race of slaves. While other creatures may be tougher or more intelligent, ophidians are servile and worship snakes as the ultimately superior creatures that the yuan-ti see themselves as. What truly makes ophidians such ideal servants however, is the serpentine curse that is transmitted through their bite. A humanoid unfortunate enough to be bitten by an ophidian may be cursed by its bite, slowly transforming into an ophidian itself. Ophidians instinctively seek to spread their curse and will bite an opponent, whenever they get the chance, preferring to capture bitten victims alive, so they may complete their transformation and become a new servant for the ophidians’ masters. This way ophidians add to their own ranks, implicitly enslaving more people into the yuan-ti’s service, even as they fight and conquer for their masters. Not all ophidians serve the yuan-ti, some associate with nagas or other creatures in whom they see the glorious and superior form of the serpent. Likewise, black and green dragons sometimes have hosts of ophidian servants. They willingly serve these creatures, even those who do treat them as mere slaves. Cursed Children. The first ophidians began their lives as a human tribe who believed serpentkind held ultimate superiority over all life and sought the power of those creatures they worshipped. They searched the ruins of an ancient yuan-ti kingdom for artifacts of power, hoping to be able to follow in the serpent people’s footsteps, but instead unleashing powerful magic that transformed them into the serpentine creatures their descendants are to this day, passing on their curse to their children and even to other creatures through their bite. Ophidians can be found in any place where snakes live and cooperate with any such creature, but prefer to seek higher creatures associated with serpents to worship and serve. Hidden Folk. Ophidians and the hideous curse they can inflict on others are not well known outside of the jungles they make their homes.

      "Primal Lycanthropes Lycanthropy is a terrible affliction that causes the victim to transform into a monstrous beast and lose all control of its actions. However, the most widely known form of lycanthropy is a mild problem and even has its advantages compared to the condition commonly known as primal lycanthropy. Uncontrollable Monsters. Common lycanthropes have a degree of control over their animal form, being able to transform into and out of their beast or hybrid form at will, and some of them even being able to maintain lucidity in these forms. Additionally they gain the lycanthropic strength and resilience even in their natural form. Primal lycanthropes on the other hand are purely at the mercy of the moon, only transforming during full moon nights, losing all lucidity once the inner beast comes to the fore and retaining no recollection of the night once the nightmare is over. They are unable to voluntarily change their shape and do not have access to any of the beast’s strength in their natural form, except that they notice their senses becoming significantly sharper. When transforming, a primal lycanthrope goes through a slow, agonizing metamorphosis and eventually changes into a hybrid form that is larger, stronger, faster and more animalistic than a regular lycanthrope’s hybrid form. They cannot transform into a pure beast form. The Raw Curse. Some theorize that primal lycanthropy is a precursor to the more common form of lycanthropy known throughout the world, which was somehow altered over time, either by a form of evolution or perhaps the magical influence of a powerful being, that had some interest in making the curse of lycanthropy into a usable power. A primal lycanthrope has no choice between resisting or embracing its curse. Its beast form is like a separate entity, lying dormant within its body until it breaks out and takes over when the full moon shines. Outside of its bestial form, the curse victim only changes subtly, finding its primal urges harder to resist, but its alignment is not affected by the curse. The primal lycanthropy curse can be cured by the same methods regular lycanthropy is cured."

      "ous reactions of other creatures they had to rely on was an insufferable waste of their precious time. These quicklings banded together in search for a way of extending their lifespans. Precious years went by, as the diminutive fey scoured the world for an answer to their problem, and many of them were already nearing the final years of their lives when a strange dragon with a smooth silver hide offered them a solution. The dragon did not ask for anything in return from the quicklings, which many among them found suspicious. The oldest of the little fey agreed nonetheless, figuring that with little more than death of old age looming ahead, they had nothing left to lose. The moon dragon (see page 70), as it revealed itself to be, returned to its lair with the quicklings that had agreed to its offer, where alchemical apparatuses and containers of strange silver liquids awaited. The dragon’s servants began treating the the fey with injections of these and other liquids. Within a few hours, the treated creatures began to change, losing their hair while their skins turned at first gray, and then silver, their hands and feet warping into clawed appendages and their faces taking on monstrous, warped features with large, empty eyes. Their bodies began to feel insubstantial and temporarily dispersed as their limbs moved. As promised, the silver quicklings were no longer subject to death of old age, but this came at a cost. The treatment bound the creatures to the dragon’s will and it commanded them to go out and capture the rest of their group who had refused the treatment originally. Fluid Form. The bodies of quicksilvers are not entirely solid. As they move, they lose the stability of their form, and the faster a quicksilver moves the more its shape disperses, to a point where it turns into an insubstantial, billowing mist at top speed. They can use this property to pass through virtually any opening. Although they can transport solid items or creatures in this state, objects they carry do not share their properties and will not pass through smaller openings as they are carried, this is why quicksilvers carry special knives as weapons, which are made in part from the same substance that was used to create the quicksilvers and share their dispersing properties. Moon Dragon Servants. The original quicksilvers were eventually released from their servitude to the dragon that had created them upon its death, wandering the world and driven to acts of wanton violence by the embitterment at their betrayal. Many quicksilvers to this day serve evil moon dragons however. They have an unusual susceptibiltiy to moon dragons’ hypnotic presence, that charms and puts them under the dragons’ control. Moon dragons value the quicksilvers’ unmatched speed and evasiveness, and some evil inclined moon dragons recreate the the experiment that created the first quicksilvers to create more servants for themselves."

From their spawning, they are more formidable than the rest of their kind, as they have to be to survive their violent lifestyles for such a long time. And as they age and slay more and more victims, they only grow even more powerful. Gaining more experience and strength, these redcaps seek out even larger blades with which to cause even more gruesome carnage. They replace their already large sickles with enormous, sometimes serrated scythes. Many of them eschew their oversized iron boots, trading the deadliness of their tread for more mobility. They still prefer the protection of armored boots, but usually wear much lighter footwear.

The angelic hosts however were bested by the demon lord and slaughtered mercilessly. When Orcus returned to his domain, he created the first rot harbingers.

They attack with their long finger bones, deformed into sharp claws and hollowed like syringes, which draw the blood from the victim as they are plunged into its flesh. The blood runs through capillary tunnels in the drinker’s bones, connected by sinewy tissue at the joints and is absorbed by its bloating entrails, where it serves to heal its wounds and fractures. In turn, a sanguineous drinker sometimes uses its claws to rupture its own bloated organs, causing the blood it collected to spew forth and cover an area around it. Mixed with mucous, rotten fluids from the creature’s body, the blood spewing forward is especially slippery, allowing the drinker to restrict its opponents’ movement and gain an advantage. Origins in Blood. Sanguineous drinkers can come about in one of two ways. Either a necromancer creates it in a ritual from a corpse boiled in blood, or it arises from a particularly evil individual who died in an environment corrupted by necrotic energy and soiled with blood, such as places used for ritual sacrifices to evil deities. Sanguineous drinkers that spawned on their own tend to lurk in the place they were born, waiting patiently for victims to stray close. The drinker will make this place its lair, which over time becomes even more caked in the blood of the creature’s victims, and strewn with their eviscerated and drained corpses. Undead Nature.

The experiment went awry, instead binding the shadar-kai’s souls permanently to the Plane of Shadow, both a curse and a blessing to these fey.

Their method of construction turns them into utterly mad and violent creatures. Splintered Souls. Shardsoul slayers are never created one at a time. The process of creating these construct requires an elemental spirit to be splintered and bound to multiple prepared shardsoul slayer bodies. This process is agonizing and drives the spirit into a violent madness. The constructs radiate this madness in an aura around them, that severely disorients other creatures, rendering them defenseless in the worst of cases. When a shardsoul slayer is destroyed, its splinter or the elemental’s soul seeks out another of its kind to rejoin its parts. As it enters the other slayer’s body, the other construct is then invigorated by the sensation of becoming just slightly more whole than it was before, gaining a shortlived surge of energy. Although they yearn to be destroyed and rejoin the shards of their souls, they still desire to live long enough to inflict terrible pain and chaos. And so they seek to meet violent ends in particularly brutal and hard fought battles.

Whatever the case, it is true that shardsoul slayers are extremely dangerous and appear just as likely to turn on their creators as they are to serve. Being used as shock troops and vanguard scouts, shardsoul slayers occasionally escape their masters and seek out places where they can wreak the most havoc. As such they are drawn to populous areas, wether in the Underdark or on the surface. Other shardsoul slayers turn directly on their derro masters and will slaughter their creators. Once their madness induced rampage is satiated, they may remain within the bloodied and abandoned ruins, confused as to what to do with themselves, or begin wandering and seeking places to vent their violent insanity against more victims.

Aside from their distinct coloration, they are marked by a set of three long horns extending from their heads Arcing Predators. Shocker lizards hunt for smaller prey, such as fish and small reptiles and mammals. They make use of the damp condition of their preferred habitats, which conducts their electricity and allows them to stun prey more efficiently. Shocker lizards are ambush predators who are comfortable waiting passively for prey to happen by their hiding spot which is when they strike with an electric discharge, stunning their prey and then attacking with their bite, or swallowing the stunned prey alive, if it is small enough. When they are gathered in greater numbers, shocker lizards are not afraid to go after larger prey. When arcing their lightning between them, the shocker lizards’ discharges become more potent with each lizard contributing and turn from stunning to downright lethal shocks. The lizards will avoid attacking in melee until their target is stunned or otherwise incapacitated and only then use their electrically charged bites to finish it off. Electric Warning Display. Like most natural animals, shocker lizards dislike fighting and will not attack larger creatures unless they are very hungry and outnumbering their prey. When faced with a potential opponent, it will usually use a clicking warning sound to deter the intruder. The clicking is produced by subtle elctrical discharges which can be sensed by creatures within ten feet of the lizard, as a tingling feeling in their skin and hair.

      "Skulks are hairless humanoids, not unlike androgynous humans in appearance. Though their natural skin tone is grey, they can change it to adopt any color, as subdued or as vibrant, as light or as dark as they wish. But even when assuming a human skin tone, their deep blue, pupilless eyes remain as an identifying feature. Untouchable and Unseen. The creatures today known as skulks were once members of an underprivileged caste of an ancient human empire. As this empire began to crumble, these people withdrew from the world using a magical ritual, which would give literal meaning to their untouchable status. The skulks gained the ability to conceal their presence, fading from sight almost entirely and even leaving hardly any tracks in their path and resisting divination magic, granting them peerless stealth and evasiveness. Nocturnal Murderers. Many skulks take pride in their acts of violence and those among them who display the greatest skill at assassination and silent murder become leaders of their communities. They organzie into small bands, generally referred to as coteries, which stalk human towns and cities, emerging at night to steal supplies and other necessities. These raids usually leave behind murdered victims, from night watchmen being in their way, to innocent people sleeping nearby, simply because the skulks revel in the senseless violence they cause. Skulks particularly enjoy going after nobles and rich merchants, seemingly in an act of retribution toward the privileged class that treaded over their kind in ancient times. A murder scene left behind by skulks often cause onlookers to jump to the conclusion of a ghost cult or similarly outlandish scenarios, as the skulks are particularly adept at entering and leaving without leaving any trace. A skulk which allows itself to be tracked and followed to the coterie’s lair will face swift and fatal punishment from their leader. Not all skulks indulge in bloodletting and murder, those among them who chose to abstain from such vile indulgences usually eke out their existence by scavenging and stealing from human societies. Thanks to prejudice, they are no less reviled by humans than their own murderous kin, and rarely have a chance of properly joining civilized society. Other skulks disdain these individuals as well and so these tragic creatures have to live in hiding from both humans and their own kind. Indiscriminate Assassins. The more skilled among skulks make highly effective hired assassins, and callous or cruel individuals often seek the service of skulks in order to “remove” political opponents or other people presenting an obstacle to their plans. The hand of a skulk assassin is recognizable by the fact that aside from the assassin’s mark and perhaps their bodyguards, several victims can be found, who were of no importance and would not have posed an obstacle to the killer. Nonetheless aside from a trail of bodies, it is nearly impossible to find traces of the assassin’s presence.",

Skullbats however are not related to these creatures. They are undead rather than creatures of fiendish origin and are created from dying vampires. Doubly Cursed. Slaying a vampire is not an easy task, despite its many weaknesses, conventional weapons barely wound the creature and even then the wounds caused will heal quickly. In order to make sure, a vampire dies and stays dead, the would-be vampire slayer will likely expose it to sunlight, running water or holy water or attempt to sever its head. When a vampire attempts to escape death by transforming into its bat form just before being decapitated, the transformation can be interrupted in a grotesque manner if the head is severed after the transformation was initiated but before it is completed. The bat wings sprout from the vampire’s head, as it is lopped off its body. The vampire’s consciousness remains preserved in the severed and bloodied head, and it is forced to retreat in this state, fluttering away on its wings. With its body destroyed and the transformation only partially completed, the state of the vampire head quickly deteriorates, as its flesh withers and its mind goes insane, stuck in this pitiful new form. Messy Feeders. A skullbat retains its vampire form’s thrist for blood, however without its body, this process becomes much more difficult. The skullbat must latch onto its victim, biting deep into its flesh and draining blood from a wound that opens further and further as the skullbats teeth dig deeper, trying to maintain its hold. As it feeds the skullbat gets routinely covered in the blood spilling from its victim’s growing wound, which results in skullbats’ routinely blood-drenched appearance. Cruel Punishment. Some highborn or otherwise influential vampires use transmutation magic to tease out another vampire’s bat form transformation or magically dominate them and force them to change. They use this to transform vampires who betrayed them or broke their laws into skullbats as punishment. Such a fate is worse than death to a vampire and the prospect of this punishment helps vampires of high status keep even large vampire courts in line. While most will reslease the pathetic creature to fend for itself, some vampires keep the skullbats they create in punishing their underlings as lowly pets. This serves both to further punish the creature and to remind other servants of what fate awaits those who would defy the vampire. A particularly vindictive vampire lord may sometimes have entire aviaries filled with skullbats, which they might release upon intruders or in a fit of vengefulness when a nearby mortal town incurred the vampire’s wrath.

They can twist their heads in any direction thanks to their long and flexible necks. Purloiners of the Arcane. The only well-known fact about spell weavers is that they seek magic items. Almost every time another sapient creature encounters a spell weaver, the weaver is in search of magic items belonging to other creatures. While usually solitary, spell weavers do occasionally organize with each other into raiding parties, when the item or items they wish to acquire are beyond the reach of a single weaver. These raids are extremely well organized, based on extensive reconnaissance and investigation done beforehand, through scrying magic and traditional spy work aided by their innate ability to cast invisibility. Isolated Minds. Spell weavers do not—and quite possibly cannot— communicate with other creatures. They possess no form of vocalization and only communicate with others of their kind using an otherwise extremely potent and long ranging innate telepathy. Even attempts to communicate with a spell weaver or to probe its mind using telepathic magic will consistently fail. The spell weavers do not express any sign of desire or willingness to share any information or make conversation with other creatures either. Even when pressed to reveal anything using simple methods, such as gestures or written language, the spell weavers will typically refuse to cooperate. It is unknown wether they even understand other languages or their writing.",

If it does, the spell does not expend a spell slot for the spell weaver. The spell weaver can tap into the disk’s energy for multiple spells at a time, if it wishes. If a creature other than a spell weaver tries to tap into a chromatic disk’s energy, the attempt automatically fails.

They wear their greasy reddish brown hair in proud, bushy messes with scraggly beards and sideburns. Spriggans are unclean creatures with the smell of rancid flesh hanging about them at all times. They are extremely numerous throughout woodlands in temperate and cold regions. They wander their forests in packs, occasionally raiding towns and villages nearby. Wandering Pillagers. Spriggans might very well make their own permanent residences weren’t it for the local population quickly driving them out wherever they choose to linger for more than a few days. They make their temporary lairs in dismal burrows or remote ruins deep in the woods, from which their packs seek out nearby villages and towns to rob and pillage. On their raids, spriggans will take anything from basic necesseties, such as food and drink, to shiny trinkets and especially weapons and armor, for which they have a particular fondness. A spriggan pack rarely owns anything they did not unlawfully take from someone else. If they are especially desparate, some individual spriggans will attempt to gain entrance into towns by disguising themselves as gnomes. Once inside a town’s walls, they sneak around and steal from the local populace in quiet. Mixed Tactics. When entering combat, a spriggan pack usually swarms between the opponents’ ranks before using their innate ability to magically enlarge their form. They grow in size to ogre-like dimensions along with their equipment, turning their usually small weapons into dreadful, oversized blades in the process. Opponents unfamiliar with spriggans are caught off-guard by the sudden change and prodigious strength an enlarged spriggan can bring to bear. Meanwhile other spriggans slink through the shadows and support their enlarged kin using their innate magic to cast shatter. They are also capable of casting produce flame, though they rarely use this spell in combat, instead using it to start fires or create light when they need it.",

The enlarged version of the weapon is growing by two size categories, so it will use 3 times the normal weapon damage dice. The spriggan will also use its improved Strength score for the enlarged form weapon if it can. If the spriggan’s weapon has the heavy quality, the spriggan should still have disadvantage on attack rolls made with it even when it is Large, since the weapon is now so big that even for a Large creature it is oversized. You will also notice that for the spriggan presented here the damage type changes from piercing to slashing. This is because for such a large sword it makes more sense to be swung at its opponents rather than thrusted. Longswords and greatswords for example—which in their basic blade design are larger versions of the shortsword—are slashing weapons.

They are however much more intelligent than such beasts and capable of adapting their tactics to changing conditions and even outwitting opponents who believe themselves superior. War Beasts.

      "Su Monster Territorial monsters resembling baboons or mandrills in both appearance and temperament, su monsters are arboreal predators that have an unusual appetite—or perhaps disdain—for psionic creatures. They are marked by their long tails and blood red hands and feet. Su monsters are very irritable and aggressive and generally kill a lot more than they eat, be it in defense of their territory or on the hunt for prey. They bury the remains they do not eat just below the ground, leaving whatever goods and treasures the victim might have had on it lying around, marking the shallow grave. Clan Society. Su monsters form families of two parents with two young at a time. The parents hunt for food while their young stay in the nest. As the offspring mature and become stronger, they help in hunting until they are fully adult and leave to found their own families. Su monster families often group together to form clans which cooperate on their hunts, but each parent cares for its own young, ignoring those of any other su monster of the clan. This means if an infant su monster is orphaned before it is capable of hunting for itself, it is unlikely to survive, since no other members of its clan will take it in. Arboreal Guard Beasts. According to legend, su monsters were created by a powerful spellcaster to guard his forest from intruders, especially those with psionic potential. They are thought to be an arcane hybrid of humanoid and baboon somehow bestowed with an innate sense for psionic creatures. Their high potential for aggression and their vicious claws and teeth make them useful if unpredictable attack beasts indeed, and many spellcasters—and even some psions—use them for the purpose today, for which they were ostensibly created."

The worms bring the corpse to stuff itself with flesh for them to consume and reproduce inside it, occasionally ejecting worms through their puppet’s various facial orifices.

Thorns are valorous, almost fanatical warriors of the Feywild. They often serve prestigious fey as guards and guardians. For example a dryad on a mission important enough to leave her tree behind may enlist the service of a thorn to guard the tree. More whimsical fey, such as pixies or grigs who find themselves in trouble for their pranks and mischief can often count on the help of a thorn to protect them. Thorns will not pick fights but fervently protect other fey from anyone who would do them harm. While they are not afraid to face an opponent in open combat, they prefer a smarter, more subtle approach, gaining the advantage through stealth and superior maneuvering, launching vicious attacks, while their opponents are unaware, or distracted. Superstitious and uneducated folk often warn people of going into woods inhabited by thorns, but druids and rangers knowing the wood speak favorably of the fey, as they do not attack without cause and will only fight those who threaten them or the fey they are sworn to protect. Orcs and goblinoids on the other hand are frequently at odds with thorns that might live in forests in which they hunt. These thorns know that such creatures do not necessarily make a distinction between beasts and fey populating their hunting grounds when it comes to finding prey and will not shy away from cutting down trees that are sacred to the fey.

Thorns make their characteristic swords from branches of the carefully cultivated great rose bushes of the fey courts while the armor they wear is made from the leaves of the same plant, treated to become thick and gain a tough, rubbery texture.

They have four flippers and two pincer arms which they appear to be able to retract and rearrange freely within their shell, along with their head, to extend them out of their shells’ openings in any configuration they wish, allowing them to change the direction they are facing at a moment’s notice without having to actually turn their body and move any body part to wherever they find them most convenient in any given situation. While its seven extremities occupy all but one of its shell openings, the eighth opening serves as a port from which the tojanida can eject an ink, much lika squid, with which to blind opponents and cover its escape or perhaps gain an advantage in combat. Enthusiastic Eaters. Tojanidas, like most creatures of the Plane of Water, speak Aquan. What is different about the shelled creatures, is the topic dominating the content of what they talk about. Tojanidas have little else on their mind than eating and will talk to great lengths about food. It is difficult to reach to a tojanida in conversation and keep its attention without indulging its fixation. While normally even tempered, tojanidas easily become irritated if their food supply is contested by a newcomer. When another creature tries to beat them to a meal, they will swiftly and aggressively dispose of the interloper. Being omnivores, tojanidas have a very diverse diet, and they are not held back by any moral limitations that would prevent them from hunting sapient prey.

As the war raged on, this place was destroyed in a great cataclysm, leaving the primal spirits bereft of a home and abandoned by the primordials, who were focussed on their war against the gods. Resenting the gods who turned their sites into battlefields and the mortals who raised cities in their place, the spirits made a pact to take revenge and destroy everything the gods and their followers have created. The spirits abandoned their primal heritage and became flesh, given form by their bitterness which granted them strength and size far beyond that of a normal mortal. The gods however stayed safe in their domains, eluding the first tulgars. Unable to exact their vengeance, the tulgar people deteriorated into savage, barbaric clans, divided across the planes. Eventually, the desire for revenge was set aside, though never forgotten, and most of the tulgar tribes took to making an existence as mercenaries their new place in the world. Cycle of Reincarnation. Inhabiting mortal bodies came at a grave cost to the spirits. Being rejected by both the gods and primordials, a deceased tulgar’s spirit is forced to return to flesh and so tulgars maintain a swift cycle of reincarnation. However, they often reincarnate far from their tribes, giving death a dire consequence nonetheless. A reborn tulgar retains its memories from every previous incarnation. Guardians of Lost Primals. With the war that destroyed their original home in the distant past, it is rare that a primal spirit loses its identity the way the tulgars did, but when such an event occurs, all tulgars can sense it. Feeling kinship, they go to any length to seek out the wayward spirit and offer it refuge among their number. Trophy Collectors. Tulgars collect proof of their accomplishments in the form of trophies. The precise nature of these depends on the role of the tulgar in its society. The common, more martially inclined among them collect weapons and armor from their fallen foes, while spirit talkers and half spirits prefer spiritual tokens, such as fetishes, holy symbols, and religious iconography as trophies that tell of their triumph over servants of the hated gods and primordials alike. It is not uncommon for a tulgar to be carrying magic items as trophies and not be aware of it."

As their name suggests, vampiric mists seek the blood of warmblooded creatures to sustain their form. They are not undead in nature although they are often mistaken for such. A vampiric mist that cannot feed regularly cannot keep its insubstantial form intact and eventually disperses into thin air. A mist that finds plentiful prey on the other hand grows until it is large enough to divide into two individual vampiric mists. They smell of fresh blood and often attract hapless bloodsucking creatures, like mosquitoes and stirges, which are trapped by the mist’s tendrils and in turn drained of whatever blood they may have consumed recently. Vampiric mists were originally thought to be immature forms of the blood feeding ghosts known as crimson death, but are now known to be living creatures, created by a vampire spellcaster, possibly as a method of delivering blood to the vampire.

      "Verbeeg Verbeegs most closely resemble roughly ten feet tall muscular half-elves. Despite their great strength, these fey related giants much prefer trickery and deception over smashing skulls. They are greedy creatures, keen on taking riches from others, preferably by outsmarting them, using schemes and twisted promises. A Word Kept. Verbeegs are cunning giants, who like to sell themselves short, giving others the impression that they are dimmer than they really are. Once a potential victim thinks it has outsmarted a verbeeg, the giant springs its trap. such as the story of Jack Longears, who demanded a toll for crossing his bridge, but only on the way back. He made passing travellers promise to pay his toll when they returned and, whether they did not intend to travel back the other way or just take a different bridge when they would go back, travellers made their promise and Jack would let them pass. When the travellers were half-way across the bridge, the giant would pick the bridge up by the rails and tilt it toward him, his victims slid back toward him and landed at his feet, and he would collect his toll. While they are keen on scheming and on swindling others, verbeegs yet have a code of honor among them: First, a verbeeg will never give a sucker an even break. Second, a verbeeg always holds true to his word. Only a verbeeg’s word is usually vague and malleable enough to twist it to the verbeeg’s advantage at the expense of those it was given to. A verbeeg may offer his paid service, to protect a travelling merchant from orc raiders, only to stand idly by and watch in amusement as the merchant’s caravan is smashed by ogres. Or perhaps the verbeeg offered to lead the caravan along a route safe from roaming trolls and instead leads it into an ambush of hill giants it staged itself. In the Company of Brutes. Verbeegs prefer to keep big, dim-witted creatures around to serve as their foot soldiers and bodyguards, such as ogres or hill giants. If they can’t find such creatures, smaller allies that are easily bullied into service such as orcs or goblins will do as well. Being greedy creatures, verbeegs are not above hiring their own services out as mercenarie to almost anyone as long as they are well supplied with good food and strong drink and have just that little bit of wiggle room in the phrasing of their contracts that makes them feel comfortable. Dsiplacer Hide. Verbeegs hunt displacer beasts to tailor their hides into cloaks which are not only fashionable but retain the beasts’ illusory power, displacing the wearer. While these cloaks have magical properties, they are not traditionally crafted magic items and do not adjust to the wearer’s size, greatly limiting their use to those of different size.",

Organ Harvesters. Vivisectors are named for their gruesome method of attack. They seek to incapacitate their victims and then use the wickedly sharp blades extending from the ends of their arms to cut the victim’s torso open and extract organs. Vivisectors have a cavity inside their carapace which they can open to place harvested organs inside. An organ placed inside this hollow is slowly drained of its essence, withering and rotting quickly, forcing the vivisector to constantly seek new supplies. Vivisectors prefer to harvest organs from living victims because it ensures that the harvested goods are more nourishing and longer lasting, while organs that have stopped working before the vivisector can embed them within its carapace will rot away before the creature can draw much usable essence from it. This gruesome dissection and organ harvest is not only used to sustain an individual vivisector, but its also essential to its asexual reproduction cycle. In order to produce offspring, a vivisector needs to gather an increased supply of organs. It must harvest organs from no less than ten Medium humanoids before they are drained of their essence within its carapace. In this process, the parent becomes bloated. Once enough organs are harvested, they morph and gestate inside the carapace. After an incubation period of about two weeks, the parent opens its carapace and releases a smaller version of itself. The young vivisector matures to full size within another week. Night Surgeons. Vivisectors only congregate where victims are plentyful, they might be found in small communities nesting in the sewers under large humanoid towns, while vivisectors hiding on the fringes of smaller towns and villages will not tolerate the competition from others of their kind. They hunt for organs by night, often abducting their victims before harvesting them to avoid detection during the dissection process. Unnatural Biology.

Sacrificial Idols. Wicker men are usually created by druids or clerics in communities worshipping gods of death, murder or the underworld. The construct is set aflame with a criminal imprisoned in its hollow chest, and both the wicker man and the prisoner are sacrificed in the process. In case the cult cannot find a criminal to sacrifice, they will sometimes entice a foreigner to the site of the sacrifice instead. On the rare occasions when the victim manages to escape the sacrifice, the spiritual leader of the cult may find the power to animate the wicker man through the sacrifice of innocents and send the construct to retrieve the escapee. Communities that build wicker men often create scarecrows as well (see Monster Manual p. 268) which can aid in capturing or recapturing the wicker man’s sacrificial victims. Burning Man. A wicker man is not a highly sophisticated construct, it will follow orders from its creator directly and, in the absence of direct commands, can fulfill a simple program of instructions such as “capture four victims and return to me.” While it looks and indeed is very flammable, an animated wicker man cannot be destroyed by fire. It will burst into flame and continue to burn, only making it more dangerous to its enemies, and causing anyone it has caught in its cagelike chest to be burned alive within. Construct Nature.

      "The killoren—or wilden, as they are known in the Common tongue—are a young race of feylike humanoids with distinct, almost feline features. They walk on digitigrade legs ending in clawed paws and are covered in sleek fur matching the coloration of the wilderness of their homes. Most recognizable perhaps are the split manes of long hair standing off of their heads, mimicing the curve of their long ears. Nature’s Answer. The cause for the sudden emergence of the wilden is unknown. Some theories hold that they were consciously created by a god of nature, others believe they were born of the untamed whims of nature itself. Whatever the reason, the purpose of their existence seems to be to balance out the growing influence and power of the humanoid races. Wilden are as comfortable navigating the streets of a crammed city as they are meditating in a serene forest clearing. They are as yet rare compared to humans, elves, or even dragonborn and have only come into isolated conflicts with evil forces attempting to despoil nature. It is obvious that they are destined for more however. Wilden are staunch protectors of the natural world and will vehemently oppose anyone who would destroy or defile it. Many of them are druids, rangers, or green knights, or working closely together with such individuals of other races, fey or humanoid. Among the wilden’s most despised enemies are the Far Realm and its unnatural denizens. Wilden destroy such aberrations without hesitation and without mercy. Wilderness Manifest. Wilden are the power of the wilderness made flesh and can manifest its aspects, aiding them in different tasks defending their domains. Some wilden favor certain aspects of nature over others, but are not opposed to using those other aspects should the need arise. No Place of their Own. Wilden can live comfortably in almost any climate and though they have no kingdoms of their own, small isolated wilden communities can be found all throughout the world. Their settlements blend beautifully into the environment and an untrained observer could not tell where nature ends and the settlement begins. The wilden’s concept of ownership of territory differs from that of humanoid races. A wolf pack may have its hunting grounds which it will not share with other packs, but it belongs as much to them as to the deer grazing there. Wilden see the land as belonging to nature itself first and foremost and make no difference between an estate, village or town and unowned land. Similarly they do not structure leadership on authority. The closest equivalent to leaders in a wilden community are elder druids and wizards who serve more as councilors and protectors than leaders making decisions for the community as a whole. Any wilden can rise to such a position based on merit. Many wilden are drawn away from their communities to instead mingle with the populations of humanoid towns, often becoming adventurers.",

Utterly demented and twisted souls with physical forms to mirror the condition of their rent minds. A wrackspawn’s limbs and torso are often bent unnaturally and their molten and burnt flesh littered with horrific wounds. Their disfigured faces lack eyes, suggesting they use some other unnatural sense instead. Carriers of Torment. For most good souls it takes years, sometimes even decades, to fully succumb to the horrific tortures their demonic captors administer to them and fully transform into a wrackspawn. Yet even when their transformation is complete, these lost souls continue to inflict pain upon thmselves, pulling broken bones from their own mangled bodies to craft spearlike bone-blades suffused with the pain they have endured. These wicked instruments confer their years of torment upon those they struck, causing debilitating pain to run through the victim’s entire body. Warped with anguish and rage, wrackspawn single-mindedly seek to inflict the horrors they have suffered onto other creatures with the help of these weapons. If a wrackspawn is stripped of its bone spear, it does everything it can to retrieve the weapon. It is incapable of creating a replacement and cannot cause the suffering it seeks to inflict without the weapon. The wrackspawn will sooner be destroyed in a hopeless attempt to retrieve its spear than give up and leave the weapon behind. Abyssal Thralls. To demons, wrackspawn are utterly expendable, they use them as fodder, bullying droves of their tortured victims into battle to distract and occupy the enemy, so that higher demons can more easily seize more important objectives. Demon-worshipping mortals sometimes receive wrackspawn as questionable gifts from their dark masters. With the creatures seeking only to destroy and inflict pain, the mortals are forced to send the monsters out into what hopefully are suicide missions to get rid of the uncontrollable burden they often pose. The monstrous creatures are often simply sent to die for the sake of being rid of them, while if the timing is fortunate, they may be sent to fulfill a role in a greater plan with their deaths. In some cases the unfortunate beneficiary of such a gift will simply set the wrackspawn loose, hoping it will not stray back to them. Wrackspawn left to roam unchecked will soon leave a trail of tortured and maimed corpses of animals and people alike in their wake. Fiendish Creatures.

While many among them are feeble in both body and mind, some of these xvarts show unusual strength and toughness, and their twisted if dim minds are in a constant state of repressed anger, which they release in battle. Bestial Speech. Most degenerate xvarts are not intelligent enough to speak cohesively in any language understood by humanoids. They do have a rudimentary understanding of Abyssal, the language native to all of their kind, but can comprehend little more than simple instructions, like a dog trained to listen to commands. Surprisingly however, their native gift to speak to bats and rats is just as well developed as that of their healthy cousins. In fact, they are strangely capable of communicating with creatures that have some form of ability to speak with animals.",

      "A bizarre, aerial predator, similar to an eyeless pterosaur with a single horn on its head, the omnivorous yrthak dominates the wastelands and desolate mountains it inhabits much in the way an insatiable dragon would, preferring the fresh meat of its prey over other food sources. A yrthak is yellowish green, with long membranous wings, short, clawed legs and a coiling arrow-tail. Sound Predators. Yrthaks are eyeless and therefor completely blind. Instead they sense their surroundings using sophisticated echolocation and excellent hearing made possible by the highly sensitive sensory bulb at the tip of their tongue. They not only use sound to locate prey but also to kill it. A yrthak can emit a focused blast of thundering energy from the horn on its head that can devastate a creature in a single hit or cause rock to rupture and explode, showering everything nearby in deadly shrapnel. Due to their reliance on sound and their highly sensitive hearing, yrthaks are however also vulnerable to sonic attacks and become effectively blind, when deafened. A deafened yrthak usually panics and and rapidly falls from the sky, sometimes crashing fatally. This makes them a preferred prey for destrachans hunting on the surface. All but Untamable. Yrthaks are generally considered wild monsters, far too dangerous and unpredictable to tame. Their sensibilities are fickle and little understood among most races. Only the gulgar (see page 111), a race that once fled from the elemental plane of earth to seek refuge in the Material Plane’s mountains found a connection to these beasts. Gulgar are among the few creatures with a sophisticated enough sense for sound and ability to manipulate their voices to successfully calm a yrthak.

Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) can be created from the appropriate corpse using an animate dead spell. Creatures marked with two asterisks (**) can be created using a create undead spell. You need the appropriate corpse or corpses for each creature rather than the type suggested in the spell’s description.",
    "Variants": "Because these statblocks are meant to be able to represent a multitude of creatures some abilities are tagged with (Variant X). A single skeleton or zombie only has the abilities of one variant. For example a Large or Huge charger skeleton has two variants. Variant A uses the regular charge ability which deals extra damage on a hit with its gore while variant B uses trampling charge which allows the skeleton to make a stomp attack as a bonus action if it knocks its target prone. In other cases an ability might simply say (Variant) without a descriptive letter. In this case the ability is an optional addition that some creatures of that type might have. Undead Nature. Zombies and Skeletons don’t require air food drink or sleep.",
    "Dragons": "Dragons can be all types of true dragons, as well as various “lesser” dragons, such as drakes, faerie dragons, pseudodragons and even dragon turtles. Due to the lack of flesh and wing membranes, skeleton dragons can’t fly or use breath attacks. Zombie dragons are heavily decayed, but both their flight and breath weapon still work to an extent. A zombie dragon’s breath weapon is less focused and sprays a significantly smaller area than that of a living dragon, and its decayed glands turn the energy it emits into necrotic.",
    "Humanoids": "The term humanoid does not only encompass creatures with the humanoid type, but any creature with a humanoid shape (for example, giants, some fey and monstrosities). Large and huge humanoids are most often the remains of giants, such as trolls, ogres or true giants. These undead are essentially larger versions of the regular skeleton and zombie in the Monster Manual. Depending on the creature it was created from, a humanoid skeleton or zombie may have different equipment. If you equip a humanoid skeleton or zombie with different weapons and armor, that increase its AC or damage output significantly, its Challenge rating should be increased by 1 or 2",
    "Beasts": "Skeleton or zombie beasts spring from the remains of a great multitude of beasts, aberrations, and monstrosities, such as bears, cockatrices, otyughs, griffons, hellhounds, lamias, tigers, wolves, wyverns and yetis. To better represent some of these creatures you may want to replace their bite or claws with more appropriate attacks, dealing a different type—but the same amount—of damage. You could even replace the bite of a Variant A Large skeleton beast with a second claw attack. Keep in mind that some natural weapons, such as tentacles, don’t have a bone structure and are not available to a bestial skeleton, while a zombie beast could very well have such an attack.",
    "Beastfolk": "Beastfolk refers to bestial or monstrous humanoid creatures, such as harpies, lizardfolk, gnolls, kuo-toa, yuan-ti or similar creatures. Even troll and medusa corpses are fit for beastfolk skeletons or zombies. Chargers Chargers are animals or monstrosities that fight primarily using tusks or horns with which they charge at opponents. This includes creatures like boars, elks, elephants, oxen, rhinos, triceratopses and unicorns. In order to fit these creatures more closely, you can replace the gore attack with a ram, dealing bludgeoning damage or a tusk attack dealing slashing damage without changing the amount of damage it deals.",
    "Skeletons": "The regular skeleton (see Monster Manual p. 272) represents skeletons of most types of medium sized humanoid. The following statblocks can be used for a multitude of creatures, from more monstrous humanoid creatures, to various general types of animals and even some more exotic creatures."

It can momentarily transform into a shape vaguely resembling a rhinoceros to make a single, devastating charge attack."
